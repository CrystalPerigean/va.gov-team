# Research Plan for Benefits Team 1: Initial Decision CST Research

![Artboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95102058/223499048-193a8848-d8ac-4b22-8a42-9fed6a8c4a81.png)

## Background

In [past research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-11-Decision-Reviews/research-findings.md), we have found that Veterans are not fully satisfied with the claim status tool. In particular, we have heard that it doesn't provide enough detail and that Veterans often feel like they're in the dark while waiting for updates about their claims. 

**This research will be a co-design session** where we review the production version of CST with veterans who currently have claims in progress, highlighting pain points and brainstorming possible design changes to improve the overall experience. 

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following OCTO Objectives: 

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This work touches on various aspects of the Veteran Journey. These findings will be relevant to whenever a Veteran is applying for disability compensation benefits, which can happen at any point along their life journey. 

## Research Goals	
With this research, we want to speak to Veterans who are currently waiting for decisions on disability compensation claims they filed on VA.gov. We want to understand what's working and what's not working about the CST experience while they are waiting for this claim. The sessions will be used to identify issues with CST and brainstorm possible solutions.

There are three areas in particular that we hope to explore:

- We want to understand **what information Veterans specifically want to know to stay informed** as their claim goes through the initial decision process.

- We want to understand **the experience Veterans have with requests to provide additional evidence.** We want to find opportunities to help Veterans provide better evidence in support of their claims, earlier in the process.

- We want to understand **the experience Veterans have with requests for C&P exams.** We want to find opportunities to set the right expectation for Veterans going to C&P exams.

### Outcome
Hopefully by the end of this study we will have a better idea of: 
- What is confusing about the CST experience for Veterans who are awaiting claim decisions. 
- What is working well in CST for these Veterans. 
- What are the top features or product improvements that might make CST more helpful for veterans awaiting claim decisions. 

### Research questions
Part 1: Warm up
- What do you typically use VA.gov for? 
- How long have you been using VA.gov?
- Do you interact with the VA in other ways – in person, on the phone?
- Do you currently have a claim in progress on VA.gov? (They should.)
- About how long ago did you file this claim? 

Part 2: Log in in to VA.gov
- [Navigating to CST] Tell me what you see here.
- What do you think is the status of your claim?
- On a scale of 1-5, how clear would you say the status of this claim is?  
- Is there any action that you think you need to take here? What makes you think that?
- Do you have a clear sense of what other actions will be required from you as this claim goes through the review process? Why or why not?
- Did you do a C&P exam as part of the claim process? If yes, how did you know that you had to do that? 
- What is the most confusing part of this web page?
- What is the most helpful part of this web page? 

Part 3: Co-design exercise 
- See details in [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2023-03-Initial-Decisions-CST/conversation-guide.md)


### Hypothesis

- The claim status information presented in the current CST UI is not informative enough for Veterans.
- The main issue for Veterans is not the CST UI itself, but the amount of time it takes for the claim to get resolved.  

## Methodology	

**Semi-structured interviews**
The primary goal of this research is to get the participants' honest, visceral reaction to a live CST environment with their real claims. As such, there are specific prompts and focus areas that will help guide the discussion (see above) but the format will be highly conversation, flexible, and hopefully highly collaborative between moderator and participant. 

### Location
Remote on Zoom

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
For this study we want to talk to Veterans who **currently have an open disability compensation claim** and who have a valid VA.gov account (we don't want them to have to create one during the session). We will be reviewing the Veteran's **actual VA.gov signed-in experience** with them to identify challenges and pain points. 

> Are you currently waiting on the result of a disability compensation claim? 

- Participants should respond "Yes" to this.

> Have you received requests from the VA to provide additional evidence for your disability compensation claim? 

- Experience with additional evidence requests is not mandatory but preferred for participation.

> As a part of your claims process, did you have to undergo a claim exam? These might also be called a C&P exam or a compensation and pension exam.

- Experience with C&P exams are not mandatory but preferred for participation.

### Recruitment criteria

** **KICKOFF CALL WITH PERIGEAN REQUESTED** **

Possible dates/times for kickoff call:
- Tue, March 14th: 11 AM - 12 PM
- Wed, March 15th: 2 - 3 PM
- Thu, March 16th: 10 - 11 AM or 11 AM - 12 PM

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

We are looking for Veterans who have an open disability compensation claim. They must be willing to log in and share screen, which may contain personal information. They must have an authenticated account that they can log into.

We would like to recruit 20 veterans. We would like representation from the following underrepresented groups: 

- 6 Black veterans
- 6 Hispanic veterans
- 10 rural veterans
- 10 veterans without a college degree

**Secondary criteria**

Participant experience with C&P exams and receiving requests for additional claims evidence are preferred. Ideally, 12-16 of study participants will have experiences with receiving requests for additional evidence or C&P exams, or both.

## Timeline
March - April 2023

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.
