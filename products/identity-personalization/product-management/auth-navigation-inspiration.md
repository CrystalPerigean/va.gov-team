# IA/Navigation inspiration

In the event we eventually do a comparative analysis on authenticated IA or navigation patterns, these are some sites that might be worth looking at:

## Without login

- [Kansas City Missouri](https://www.kcmo.gov/home)
  - "I want to..." nav

## With login

[Liz already did some work on this](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/discovery-research/comparative-analysis/personalization-profile-comparative-analytsis.pdf).

### Questions for sites with login:

- How different are the logged-out/logged-in navs?
- In the logged-in state, how easy is it to find (what you would assume to be) top tasks?
- What can you do logged-in that you can not do logged out?
- If you needed something in the logged-out state, how would you get back to it? How easy/hard does that feel?
