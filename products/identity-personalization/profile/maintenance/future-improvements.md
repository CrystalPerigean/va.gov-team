#  Ideas for Future Profile Improvements

**Last updated: March 20, 2023**

## Profile-wide
- Re-examine borders on tables and how we're handling that. Are they necessary? We need padding if we have borders and this takes up precious real estate on small screens
- Can profile be smart enough to inform people of relevant things when they're making edits (e.g. tell people their prescriptions will go to this new address when they're making changes to the address field and we know they have prescriptions)

## Contact information
- How might we make the distinction between sign-in email address and contact email address less confusing for people?

## Military history
- How might we make it easier for Veterans to access their DD214?
