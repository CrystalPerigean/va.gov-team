# Fully Authenticated Check-In Support

## Summary

Allow some of our authenticated applications (e.g. Mobile app, Health Apartment, VAOS) to use the PCI API to pre-check-in and check-in a Veteran for their appointment.

This will require engineering to update chip, vets-api and possibly LoROTA. At a minimum CIE team will have to write LoROTA-less versions of the lambdas that allow veterans complete pre-check-in and check-in tasks. In addition it may require a new module within vets-api to provide all neccessary endpoints for fully authenticated applications to check-in to an appointment. LoROTA probably can and should be avoided as that system was designed to enable e-check-in with a minimal amount of authentication.

### Tentative Integration

    actor vet as Veteran
    participant vam as VA-Mobile-App
    participant va as vets-api
    participant chip as Chip

	vet->>+vam: Appointment eligible for check-in and click 'Check-In'
	vam->>+va: POST /patient_check_ins
  va->>+chip: POST /CheckInMobile
  chip--)chip: do all the things
  chip->>-va: 200 ok
  va->>-vam: 200 ok
	vam->>-vet: check-in completed
```

## Questions:

How will the app communicate that check in has been started?
- Through a process of answering questions
- Automatically when it decides to show the check in button for an appointment
  - Problem: could assume too much

How will we know if their demographics have been updated?

Can we see their appointment payload? (VAOS)

Do they know which appointments have e-check-in enabled?
- Check in enabled boolean probably not provided(Stephen)

How can we have security confidence that the patient is checking into only their appointments?

[LP] Currently, the mobile app gets their appointment info from VAOS; to test in a Staging environment, the Mobile App team has to get the VAOS team to create appointments for them in the Vista instance that VAOS uses; we need to determine if this is the same Vista instance that the CIE team uses for the Staging tool; if it is not, I'm not sure how we are going to test in Staging

## Internal questions:

Should we create a new vets-api module for fully authed applications(suggestions from Stephen)?

Where do we update CW? Assume itâ€™s the same as e-check-in

What does CHIP currently do?

## What needs to happen to be able to check-in
- Appointment needs to be at a clinic with e-check-in enabled
- Appointment must be within check-in window
- Patient must of current insurance info (our business rule)
- Patient must have confirmed demographics in the past 7 days (our business rule)
- Set eCheckInStarted (happens in initiateCheckIn now), setCheckIn, and eCheckInComplete in vista
- Log success
