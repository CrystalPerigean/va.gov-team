# Feedback

_The path to request new hearing aid batteries. As the programmer I had to get help on where to find this._

Has hearing loss due to military experience. Was told could get new hearing aids on VA.gov, but couldn't find. Had to call friend to help find. 

**Can you show us the path you are referring to? Why do you think it is so confusing?**

Went to "Refill and track prescriptions" -> Refill VA prescriptions. Can't figure out where to go from here. Used to pop up another page w/ legal jargon, at bottom "Order new hearing aid batteries". Now, lost again. 

Legal page that used to show up - very annoying. 

**Where else would you place hearing aid batteries?**

Starting at VA home page. Clikcs on "Refill and track VA prescriptions" - finds "Order hearing iad batteries" on left hand nav. Clicks on green button "Oder hearing aid batteries" - takes to new page. Feels like too many clicks. 

Wants to get rid of four boxes on homepage. 

**Coulton directs to va.gov/new-home-page to get feedback.** 

Scrolls down. Looks at "About VA" at top. Goes to "Top pages" -> sees Refill or track a prescription. 

Likes that disability rating available at top of screen. Found out when came to VA.gov, saw that rating had gone up. 

# Find VA Events and News articles

How do I find events here? It's nowhere. Not finding in "About VA." 

Some good events - one was "What can VA do for you?" Articles, events. Likes that PACT up there. 

If it was me, would put under PACT Act/ "Welcome to VA.gov". 

**Chatbot**

Good idea. Would rather type due to hearing loss than try to call. Would think it would be in bottom right hand corner. "Talk to the VA." 

Too many clicks to get to chatbot. Concerned that would be challenge to find, particularly for blind Veterans. 

**Service member vs. Veteran**

Same or different? Do they have different benefits? (Clicks on link - expresses confusion as VA should be post separation from military.) 

**Newsfeed**

Suggests perhaps having rolling newsfeed (click right/left arrow to see multiple news). Doesn't think he would notice VA News section because wouldn't scroll down. 

Got confused when linked back over to his authenticated account. Was confused because banner/header changed when left new home page to account. 

**My VA**

Disability rating - needs to be easy to find. Letter w/ this info very importnat to find easily. 


# MHV


_Images are impossible to pull up. I have MRI images from 2 years ago that I still cannot view_


**What makes images impossible to pull up for you? Why can you still not view them from 2 years ago?**

Clicks on "Labs and Tests" - assumes images there. Not able to look for them there. (Expect to be there?) I don't know, but would assume either Labs and Tests or Health History. 

Tries "Health History" - can't find there. 

Goes back to home page - can't find Blue Button records (under Health Records). 

Tries "Track Health." -> Health History -> ends up at same Health History page. 

Tries "Medical Events" - can't find. 

_Coulton instructs to go to "Personal Information" -> Download my Data._ 

Goes to VA Medical Imaging and Reports summary -> clicks "View Report" -> "your report is currently being loaded" -> "loading"

Should I click "Done"? What is happening? 

Will come up with blank pdf - nothing there. Not sure why. Not sure what it's trying to do. 

Tries Blue Button "Download my record." Problem have here - surgery was 20 years ago, can't get from here because 10 year limit (in filters). 

Clicks "Custom" - doesn't select the date in dropdown calendar so date stays 2022. (User error.) 

_Robyn flags error that's occurring._

New reports available - but unclear what report includes by title. Clicks open report -> says no information available. 

Treatment center - didn't allow to select. 

**When want to download report vs. view online?**

Trying to get record of issue 20 years ago is due to disability rating. Had to get lawyer to help him retrieve records he needed. Not sure if could have gotten info by calling Augusta. 

Got image sent to him on CD. Not able to figure out what to do by online instructions. 

Confusing because assumed images would be available based on title "VA Medical Images and Reports". Would like clearer content. 

**My VA**

Likes that Oustanding debts easy to find in My VA. Previously, couldn't find information easily. 




# Didn't get to - 

_Getting back to VA.gov (no direct link)._


**Can you tell us more about this? In what common situations would you want to go from MHV back to VA.gov?**


_For Med records. Not sure the 10 year rule came from but as a Veteran I should be able to pull any of my med records_


**When you refer to med records, which part of MHV are you referring to?**


# Other

_In response to Lauren saying, "I think some of the planned improvements to the new portal will address some of these questions. I.e. we’ll have a section in the portal to reorder medical supplies, s/a batteries, CPAP supplies, etc. We’re also doing a pretty big overhaul over the records section, which we’re hoping will yield a better user experience. And in the meanwhile, we’re working on designing better pathways between the two sites while myhealth.va.gov is up."_

_You said,_

_This will continue to be a problem and it is still not that clean yet since the Veteran is still seeing all the page changes rather than one page stating “Wait while we process your request” and al the page flicking is in the background._


**What did you mean by this? Can you show us?**
