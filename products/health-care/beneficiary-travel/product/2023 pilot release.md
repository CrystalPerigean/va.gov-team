# Travel Pay + PCI Release plan 

## Theory we are testing

As a Veteran seeking care at a VA facility, I can submit a simple Beneficiary Travel claim (mileage only, no other receipts, traveled by personal vehicle from home address, 1 appointment) during the digital check in process. 

## Prep work 

- [x] feature toggle and facility restriction is in place
- [ ] Analytics are in place 
- [ ] Colab Cycle has passed 
- [ ] Coordination with Facility is complete
- [ ] Getting Travel Office on board
- [ ] Go/no-go decision made on ______

## Production rollout

**How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it**

We have a feature toggle and the ability to restrict to Veterans only at a facility


### Define the Rollback process

We will roll back if 

#### 1) Error rates are high

**Condition**: If there are >5% (adjustable) error rate of submission, then we will disable the feature via feature toggle 

**Where are the numbers located**: [Datadog_link]

**Who is watching** Mark Dewey + PCI team 

**path to reenable** Dev team will Address the Error and deploy a solution


#### 2) Travel office gets overloaded with manual claims

**Condition**: IF the number of claims in the manual process overwhelms the travel office

**Where are the numbers located**: See KPI 3 & 4

**Who is watching** Mark Dewey + Travel Pay Office

**path to reenable** Mark Dewey will work with the various teams to lead a retro to identity the issues and create a solution. 


### Questions to answer after each Phase

- Is this providing value to the Veteran?
- What is the Veterans response to this? (VSignals, on premise feedback)? 
- What is the Clinicians response to this? (VSignals, on premise feedback)? 
- How is this affecting the Travel office workflow?
- What minor tweaks can be made before rolling this out to more Veterans?
- What new metrics arise that we care about? 

### Phase Staged Rollout 

#### Phase: First Facility  - Wilkes Barre

> Back office for Travel pay is not flooded with claims

- **CURRENT --** [CLAIMS_THAT_ARE_MANUALLY_REVIEWED]
- **GOAL --** The ratio of [CURRENT_CLAIMS_PER_DAY_AT_WB]:[CLAIMS_THAT_ARE_MANUALLY_REVIEWED]:[CLAIM_REVIEW_TIME](186:39:8 days ) stays roughly the same
- **Key Numbers to look at**
    - [CURRENT_CLAIMS_PER_DAY_AT_WB] :186
    - [CLAIMS_THAT_ARE_MANUALLY_REVIEWED]:39
    - [CLAIM_REVIEW_TIME]: 8 days, Avg days to claim paid
