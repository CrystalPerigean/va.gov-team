  - Full explanation: What does it mean to have a presumptive condition for toxic exposure?
To get a VA disability rating, your disability must connect to your military service. For many health conditions, you need to prove that your service caused your condition. 

But for some conditions, we automatically assume (or “presume”) that your service caused your condition. We call these “presumptive conditions.”

We consider a condition presumptive when it's established by law or regulation.

If you have a presumptive condition, you don’t need to prove that your service caused the condition. You only need to meet the service requirements for the presumption.

**presumptive location / presumption of exposure:** We base eligibility for VA disability compensation benefits, in part, on whether you served in a location that exposed you to Agent Orange. We call this having a presumption of exposure.
**specific environmental hazards:** toxic chemicals in the air, water, or soil.

**mustard gas or lewisite**

**spina bifida**

**Camp Lejeune:** Goes along with MCAS New River

**Southwest Asia theater of operations**
