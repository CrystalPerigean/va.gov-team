## Notes

- Welcome (back) to Joni!
- Jonathan shared a [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1677775946971/1e8d73d4013ecec84b932c699ce1cf8584cb7e35?invited=true&sender=u71ad98f94f5263595f9a4390) where he has gathered preferences information from various sources.
	- Another [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/vsa8243/1645732777530/3b75[â€¦]c58f4463823ac9476e4e25dc1240f?sender=u24af215c7d9bf806b8545488) showing the information Liz Lantz on the VA.gov Profile team researched in 2022.
- Jonathan did the most digging into Profile
- Daniel agrees that Profile is probably a good place to start
- Coulton thinks this is great.  There are some Word and Excel docs that contains some of this info, but not all.  It's helpful to see this in this format
- Coulton: how much of the recommendations are based on the work Liz did?
	- Jonathan - all of them are recommendations from Liz's team thus far
- Coulton: 
	- What would be helpful is to understand the gap between what we know and what else we need to know
	- There is some information here that we definitely can do; passes the sniff test.
	- There are some things that we don't yet understand (ex - What is your Relationship with the VA.)
	- Coulton believes that every field that is editable in profile doesn't get sent anywhere else, so why do we collect that at all?
	- What does Jonathan think we should do?  
	- We want to make sure that our research is a good use of Veterans' time
	- Health Information Card - maybe we do research on that.  Occupation - we might get rid of this.
	- Emergency Contact - that could actually be dangerous, because people may think that information is being shared somewhere, so that could be a patient health risk.
	- Some of this is not controversial and don't need research, but some of these do need research
	- If Jonathan could help suss that out, it would be a great way to push this forward
- Jonathan:
	- Some of the options are already being considered in a VA.gov Profile prototype.  
	- Jonathan has already connected with Liz and discussed what they are going to incorporate.
	- Signature Settings - not sure what we're doing with this.
	- Coulton - that falls into the "why would we keep this?" categories
- Coulton:
	- Writing out this is what what previous research shows, some we logically should keep, some we could logically remove, and others that we need to do research on.
	- Message display settings - we don't need these for the new experience.
	- Secure Messaging contact list is another one.  That thing is hard.  We may need to keep it around, but it would be pending work the SM team is doing to make the triage group names something that makes sense to users.
- Marci
	- Need to think about during rollout, if we get rid of some things in the new experience, and they are still in the old, do those need to talk to each other?  Do we keep each experience self-contained?
- Coulton - there is work slated in PI10 to o research about the triage groups for contacts.  The To: line in the new experience is still pulling from the Secure Messaging Contact List.
- Jonathan - we have to take into consideration that something may have to stick around until Phase 2
- Coulton:
	- There is one version where we say we're getting rid of this and it's not in the 
	- Another version is "soft deprecated" where it's not editable.  It would be great if we have thoughts on those types of things to write that out and the rationale.  The ByLight team may need to put that work into a future PI to support that decision
- What teams are working on this:
	- Samara's team.   That's the only other team that he knows of that is thinking about this right now.  That work involves the ByLight teams to execute some of the work
	- Three teams 
		- This team 
		- Samara's team
		- Carnetta's team (Jason Boire)
