## Intro - 2 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz, and Shannon is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, I’d like to go over some basic logistics for today.

Today we're going to talk about how you do things related to benefits and services you receive from VA. You will need to log into your VA.gov  account, and share your screen, which means we might see some of your personal information. Are you comfortable with that?

**If participant declines, end the session.** That’s ok, I understand. Unfortunately, to complete the session today we would need you to do that. We can go ahead and end the session now; we really appreciate your time and willingness to be here today.

### For screenreader sessions:
- I understand that you use a screen reader, and according to my notes you use [software]. Will you be using that in the session today? 

Great, thank you. We have an accessibility specialist in the session, standing by to help if we have any technology issues.

### For all sessions:
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes / 75 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve this website to better meet the needs of people who use it. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with 3 additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete, ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Before we start looking at the website, I want to learn more about you.  When the session was scheduled you provided some information. 

- I understand you are a [*Veteran / Caregiver for a Veteran / Family member*] Is that right? 
	- *If Caregiver, confirm:* Are you a Veteran?
- And, according to my notes you have [*services/benefits from Perigean participant tracker*] through VA. Is that correct? 
- Thanks for confirming that. Are there any other benefits or services that you receive?
- Do you manage or access that benefit or service online at all? Tell me more about that.
	- *If needed:* what website do you use to do that?
- In order to join today’s session, you needed to confirm you have a VA.gov account - tell me about the last time you logged into the account. 
	* Why did you log on?
	* What did you end up doing while logged on?


### Things to note:
- What benefits/services does the participant have?
- Do they already use VA.gov to manage or access that benefit?
- If they don’t use VA.gov but they use the internet in another way, what is that other way?
- What did they last do on VA.gov?
- Was it different from their intention?

## Task 1: Complete benefit related task - 12 minutes / 24 min for screen reader sessions
**Task goal:** *See how they go about navigating to their task, ultimately on VA.gov. They may start with Google searching or something else, which is fine. Eventually, we’ll need to guide them to logging in on VA.gov if they don’t go there on their own. We’ll also want to evaluate how they’d get to this task if they couldn’t use the homepage or My VA*.

Thanks for sharing all of that with me. Now I’ll have you share your screen in zoom. Do you know how to do that? If not, I can help you.

*Guide with screen sharing if needed*

I can see your screen, great! We can get start looking at websites now.

**If participant clearly stated a benefit or service you can pull a task from:**
Now that you’re logged in, can you show me how you  [*use their language for what they ended up doing while logged in*]? 

It’ll help if you can think out loud as much as possible.

**If participant does not have any recent experience with VA to pull from, pull logged-in task from Cindy’s top task research findings:**
Imagine you wanted to get your VA medical history. Show me how you’d go about doing that. It’ll help if you can think out loud as much as possible.

*Task success: find a secure messaging CTA*

- *If needed,*
	- Tell them to open a browser
	- Can you show me how you’d do that on the VA website?
	- Tell them to decline the pop-up asking them to preview the new home page.
		
**! Stop the participant before they submit any applications, change their actual information, or go to MHV!**

Thank you for showing that to me! 

**If participant used a link from homepage or My VA:** Can you show me how you’d do that if the link to [*service or benefit*] was missing from [*the homepage or My VA*]? 

- *If needed*
	- I’d like to see if there is another way that works for you to get to that same information (*back them up to the homepage or My VA, whichever they used*)
	-  Where else would you go, if that link was missing from the page?

Thanks, that is helpful to see. 

### Things to watch for:
- If we were able to pull from participant experience, what task did they need to complete?
- Where does the participant start? 
	- VA.gov or somewhere else?
- What prompted the person to sign in? Did they do it right away, or from a content page?
	- What did the person click on to sign in?
- What is the navigation path the person took once they got to VA.gov to complete their task?
- Does the layout of content pages that lead to tools affect the user experience of navigating to tools?
- Was the person able to complete their task?
- What, if anything did the participant find confusing?
- Where did the person go if they couldn’t use My VA or the Homepage?
- If they couldn’t navigate to their task, what did they do?
- How does the logged-in experience line up with what they expected?

## Task 2: Complete second benefit related task - 5 min / 10 min for screenreader sessions
Now I’d like to see how you go about finding a something else on the website.  *Ok for participant to start wherever they are on the website, or from a fresh browser if that’s what they’d do.*

**If participant clearly stated a benefit or service you can pull a task from:**
Thinking about your [*benefit or service*], are there other related things you need to do online, or that you had to do in the past? Show me how you’d go about doing that, and please continue thinking out loud. You’re doing a great job with that.

**If participant does not have any additional experience with VA to pull from, pull logged-in task from Cindy’s top task research findings:**
Now imagine you have a hearing problem that has recently gotten worse, and you want to increase your disability rating. Show me how you’d go about doing that, and please continue thinking out loud. You’re doing a great job with that.

*task success: land on* [https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/)

- *If needed,*
	- Guide away from MHV or eBenefits to VA.gov 
	- Share the health hub page with them if they land on current version
	
**! Stop the participant before they submit any applications or change their actual information !**

Thank you for showing that to me! 

**If participant used a link from homepage or My VA:** Can you show me how you’d do that if the link to [*service or benefit*] was missing from [*the homepage or My VA*]?
