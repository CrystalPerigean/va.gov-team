## Overview

## Related terminology

- **File a claim:** Always use the phrase "file a claim" rather than "apply" when referring to disability compensation. 

- **Disability benefits vs. disability compensation:** We want to finalize whether we always say "compensation."

- **Service-connected condition:** We define this as "an illness or injury that was caused by—or got worse because of—your active military service." We want to get final confirmation from disability comp SME if this should always be "condition" or "disability" or if there's any nuance.

- **Illness, injury, condition:** If describing only illnesses or injuries alone, use just "illness" or "injury." If describing illnesses or injuries, use "illness or injury (also called "condition")" and then "condition" for subsequent mentions. 

- **VA disability rating:** We say "VA disability rating" on first mention, then drop the "VA" for subsequent mentions. We don't need to say "service-connected disability rating" by default.

- **Inservice disability claim:** You got sick or injured while serving in the military—and can link this condition to your illness or injury.

- **Preservice disability claim:** You had an illness or injury before you joined the military—and serving made it worse.

- **Postservice disability claim:** You have a disability related to your active-duty service that didn’t appear until after you ended your service.

- **Loss of range of motion**: Problems moving your body

- **VA disability compensation:** VA disability compensation provides tax-free monthly payments.

- **Retroactive payments:**
