# Analytics review

## Goals

- To understand patterns and behaviors around logging in.
- To understand if there are differences in what people intend to do logged in vs. logged out.
- To understand what the numbers can tell us about how people navigate the site when logged in.

## Questions to answer

**Pull analytics for the last year**

Based on the questions posed in our [research outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/README.md), we can potentially find supporting analytics that will help us address the following questions:

### Signing in to VA.gov

- What percentage of users sign in to VA.gov in [selected time period]?
- What are the [top ten?] popular pages for people to sign in on?
- How many clicks do people usually take/pages do people usually visit before signing in?
- What are peoples' next clicks **after** signing in?
- What is the % breakdown of people who click sign in CTAs vs. "Create Account" CTAs?
- For people who click "Create Account", where are they coming from (previous page)?

### Navigating to tasks & tools

- What is the breakdown of:
  - Most popular pages overall (**Note**: I know we already know a lot about top tasks, so this is more for reiteration/context setting)
  - Most popular landing pages
  - Most popular pages visited while signed in
  - Most popular pages visited while signed out
- What are the average number of pages visited on the site in a session?
  - Logged in
  - Logged out
- For the [top ten?] most popular logged in tasks, how many clicks/page visits does it take for people to get to those pages?
- For the [top ten?] most popular logged in tasks, what are the top previous pages?

### Search

- Top search terms 
- How often is search used/search button clicked? (Search.gov might need to help us)
- How often are people clicking best bets for search (especially if task-related)?
