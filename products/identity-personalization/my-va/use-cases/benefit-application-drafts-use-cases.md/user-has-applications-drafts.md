# My VA Benefit Application Drafts Use Case: User has a benefit application draft saved but not yet submitted

**Last updated:** April 13, 2023

For LOA3 users who sign in and have a benefit application draft saved (or multiple), we will show a card (or cards) for their saved application(s) in the Benefit application drafts section on My VA that provides a link for them to continue their application.

## UX
- Any logged in LOA3 user can see the Benefit application drafts section on My VA.
- Below the Benefit application drafts header, the user will see an expandable dropdown that says “What benefits does VA offer?” 
	- If the user expands this dropdown, they will see a list of links for all VA benefits which link to the same landing pages as the main navigation: Health care, Education and training, Disability compensation, Careers and employment, Pension, Housing assistance, Burials and memorials, Life insurance, Service member benefits, and Family member benefits.
- When a user has a benefit application draft saved, they will see a card in this section that tells them the form code, application type, an expiration date for the application, the date that they last opened it, and a link to continue the application.
- This card is always displayed on the left hand side of the page on desktop when there is only one card to show.
- If a user has multiple benefit application drafts saved, they will see a card for each of them in this section and they are displayed side by side on desktop with two max per row.
- Uses the [card component](https://design.va.gov/components/card) from the VA design system.

## How to reproduce
- Find a staging user who has a benefit application draft in the [benefit application drafts staging user test cases](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/vagov-users/staging-test-accounts-myvaaudit.md#saved-applications-section).
- Log into staging.va.gov with a test user who has a saved benefit application draft.
- Once logged in, you will be redirected to My VA.
- Verify that you see the dropdown for VA benefits below the section header.
- Verify that you see a card for the saved application in this section and that it links to the page where the user can continue the application.
