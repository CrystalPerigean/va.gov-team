[Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-conversation-guide.md) 

## Findings (Wins)

**Alerts page**

- All users easily understood what the alerts page was for
- Users were able to understand how to take action on an alert (eg links inside of alerts)
- Users easily understood and wanted alerts to be ordered chronologically
- Most users wanted an archive of alerts at least 1 year back (somewhere to see all past alerts)
- Some users responded positively to alerts going back 30 days 
- Users responded postively to having alerts on My VA, as well as having a separate alerts page
- Redundancy of alerts was welcomed and important 
- Most users recieve emails and text and would not be confused if they came to VA.gov and saw the same thing
- Users liked the amount of information shown in each alert
- Users were really excited and surprised to see something that was so personalized to them
- Multiple users called out the exclamation point icon as something that made sense 

**Alerts link/indicator**

- All users easily found the omni-present Alerts page link in the navigation
- All users easily understood the red dot indicator
- All users easily understood the term 'Alerts' and what it meant 

**Alerts on My VA**

- Users expected there to be an alerts section in My VA
- Users were not bothered by having an alerts section as well as an alerts page
- Users understood the difference between the pages

## Findings (Pain points)

**Alerts page**

- There was some concern about 'important' alerts getting lost or buried
- Some users wanted to categorize alerts or be able to tell alerts apart by category
- Users also mentioned wanting the ability to sort or filter alerts
- No users knew what the form number meant
- Users mentioned wanting some more specificity around the form alert (eg form name) and messages (eg subject)
- Users wanted more differentiation between time sensitive alerts and non-time sensitive alerts 

**Alerts on My VA**

- Users were confused by why they were seeing the specific alerts that they were seeing on My VA - many thought the alerts shown on My VA were higher priority, not the most recent.
- Almost all users missed 'View all alerts' initially, but when directed to it they easily understood where it would go
- Users were confused by the text '3 latest alerts in the last 30 days'

## Other

**Prioritization**

- Most users could not point to what was 'the most important alert' - many mentioned that it completely depends what is happening in a Veteran's life. Most users did not expect the VA to know what the most important alert was. A few users also mentioned wanting to have the ability to customize alerts and choose which ones were a priority.  
- Many people said that if there is something that is going to expire or you have to be somewhere at a certain time - that would make an alert important.
- Time sensitivity is an important factor when it comes to prioritization
- Almost all users prioritized the unfinished form alert and the appeal hearing reminder, closely followed by appointments

**Commonly mentioned things**
- Appointments
- Prescriptions
- Messages
- Claims and appeals information
- Payments/financial information (debt)
- Education payments
- Home loan info (provider, local APRs)
- Referral approvals
- Annual amount of disability compensation
- Veteran organizations available to join
- Updates from the VA
- Covid-19 updates

## What should this page be called?

* Some users mentioned multiple titles

- Notifications (3)
- Action items (2)
- Alerts (1)
- Knowledge base (1)
- Status updates (1)
- Benefit summary (1)
- VA notices (1)

**All users easily understood and liked the term 'Alerts' after they saw it.** If we call the page 'Notifications', it might be confusing to a user to go to notification settings and not be able to change anything about the actual 'Notifications' page.

## Thoughts and Questions

- Apparently VA doctors can mark messages as urgent. Who do we ask about this? Do we need to account for this in the alerts section?
- A couple users mentioned wanting the ability to print out all of their appointments. I need to follow up with VAOS about this.
- We only had one user who had an active appeal, and he mentioned wanting the timeline of the appeal included. What does that look like currently on that site? Is that something that should live in an alert?
- If we have an “application in progress” alert, do we need to be cognizant of the fact that not all forms are applications, when writing the CTA and labeling it? E.g. is an appeal form an application? Is the form to change your school for edu benefits an application? I tend to think of applying is as a first time thing but maybe that’s just me
