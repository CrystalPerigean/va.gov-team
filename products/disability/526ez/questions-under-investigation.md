|How many claims include PTSD?||||This will be useful for helping to prioritize redesign of this flow in 526|
|Are all of the questions that are required still the same? Can some be marked as optional?||||This will be useful in potentially reducing time on task and in helping applicants feel secure|
|Is there a reason for character limit for field about service-connected disability?||||This will be good to know ASAP as this could be a light dev lift to change?|
|Does VBA ask for medical records from vet because it helps RVSR search for them in CAPRI?||||This is critical to know since there can be a lot of confusion about what vets need to provide, and because this could dramatically impact time on task|
|How consistent does the online version need to be with the paper version?|||||
|On average, how many pieces of evidence and what kinds are submitted with sucessful claim ||||
|Can veterans submit parts of the form without triggering a form completion and beginning the claims review process? ||||
|How do VSRS feel about NOT asking veterans to find evidence and submit to form per Shannon suggestion?  Do they consider that an extra burden? (Shannon says VSRS search anyway and only use submitted evidence as a lead)||||
