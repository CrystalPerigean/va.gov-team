## Task: [Start Application] - 5 minutes
**Quotes, notes and observations:**
- So, before I click anything
- first of all, my first impression, it looks pretty official. No ad bombs or anything like that that comes along with these websites.
- Scroll to make sure I am on the right page
- Verify the web address is dot gov, then I would just sign in
- (change add) based on first impressions, no, nothing stands out to me I guess


**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? Why did you give it that rating?

- 5 is very well? So I would say a 5
- (why) well layed out, designed to fit my mobile device, looks official

- Can you tell us more about what you would have to do in preparation for filling out this application?


- Read through all the steps required, 1, 2, I would read the entire thing, make sure this is what I am trying to do
- Get the informaiton need for application
- then sign in or create an account or whatever the next step is
- At the very bottom it says sign in to start application, I would go there.
- (signed in before VA) I have not, but I do have ID.me


### Things to watch for:
- [Quotes from participant about any content on the intro page that makes them feel uneasy, confused or not prepared to complete application.]

**Quotes, notes and observations:**
- So just trying to undersand. I understand the different rating systems, I am not going off of it. 
- That is in the back of my mind, it is a simple yes or no questions in the moment I may have complicated it in my head. Percentages
- I don't receive any compensation
- The explanation of monthly payments
- It would have decluttered the screen a bit
- to me this asks the same question, just in a different way
- I don't know the difference between compensation and pension, but I know it doesn't apply to me
- A drop down menu to declutter the screen, make it faster a little easier

[Step 3 of 6: Military service]

## Task: [Dates] - 3 minutes
**Quotes, notes and observations:**
- (used fake dates, was getting errors putting in dates for)
- Go back and read that, wasn't sure what that screen was
- Would I get more compensation if these things apply to me?
- (helpful context?) For me, these are not, to me these are not synonymous. Purple heart does not.. when I think of service history I think of time in service, rank
- I don't think of awards, that is just me
- Service history means something in the Air Force, for () and things like that
- The word service history kind of threw me off
- I am not in those age range where some of these apply, I don't see how these are in the same I don't know, category

**Quotes, notes and observations:**
- My initial thought is to skip it
- It is not required, 
- I don't have a scanner and wouldn't go thorugh the trouble
- It is just a couple extra steps, I would just skip it and provide later if needed
- As far as instructions go, it is clear
- If I did not have them, it took me 5 minutes to 5 days, it depends. 
- Like the DD214, if I had one, it would be in a portfolio printed in a safe somewhere like that
- Or maybe I would have a digital file saved perhaps,
- What mailbox it is in, I have multiple emails 
- It just depends.

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being non very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel to submit this application? Why?
- Is there any reason you wouldn't submit the application at this step?

- 5
- (why) The only thing I can think of comparring it to is my taxes
- The way I can review and verify what is here.
- I can edit on the spot, I don't have to tab all the way back
- (example of un user friendly) Once you make a mistake, have to tab all the way through the application
- This doesn't give me any of those vibes. Make the change on the spot, minimize, and submit.

- nothing that would prevent me to hitting submit

- Thinking back on the question about the first page you saw and you rated it a [x on a scale of 1-5 (1 being non very poorly and 5 being very well)], would you keep or change that rating after going through this application? Why?
Oh... it is kind of difficult to say. There was stuff it said I needed offhand and I didn't use that stuff.
I would say 5
