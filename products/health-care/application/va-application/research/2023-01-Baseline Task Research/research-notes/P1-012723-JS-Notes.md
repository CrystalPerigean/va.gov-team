- 9

- Thinking back on the question about the first page you saw and you rated it a [x on a scale of 1-5 (1 being non very poorly and 5 being very well)], would you keep or change that rating after going through this application? Why?
- no, for that was a very specific issue that made the entire page a little more confusing. If that got changed, and made clearer, if that was changed.
- If that issue, keep it at a 4.


- Did any of the questions stand out to you as unnecessary?
- No, most of it seems pretty standard. For health insurance / Veteran thing
- Veterans are very used to more questions that are more prying than you would think.


- Did anything seem to be missing?
- No, like I said. maybe in the financial eligibility, explore more into the type of discharge, not the character, and the type and how, some amplyfing imformation on the financial side.
