## Research Goals
The Health Care Application (10-10EZ) enables Veterans to access and apply for VA health care easily with any device at any time, with or without assistance. Veterans can do this either as an unauthenticated user or as an authenticated user. 

- Product | [10-10EZ Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/10-10EZ%20Health%20Care%20Application%20-%20Product%20Outline.md)

The purpose of this study was to: 

1. Obtain a qualitative baseline for tasks within the application to use in comparison with past studies and future iterations.
2. Overall, what is easy or difficult to complete within the form and why.
3. Uncover pain point areas that cause confusion and need further discovery and research.



## Research Questions
* What tasks are consistently completed by participants with ease?
* What tasks do the majority of participants struggle with or have some level of difficulty?
* How successufl are participants in completing the household information section questions?


## Methodology 

We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on **January 27 - February 10, 2023**. We had participants go through the entire application/form in the staging environment as they would if they were completing as they would.

- **Usability testing**
- **Post-task and post-testing participant questions**



## Hypotheses and Conclusions

### Hypotheses 1
The baseline study will help establish that the insights and pain points from previous studies are still consistently an issue with participants in this study.

**"Not enough information"**
- [Wireflow showing previous research insights in application flow](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/a/dlJob5E)


### Hypotheses 2
The baseline study will show that there are areas of the form that most participants complete tasks easily (entering personal information) or areas that they consistently struggle (household information and insurance).

**"Maybe True"**

- The participants generally had took more effort to answer questions in the household information section around income and the insurance questions, however participants were also confused in the VA benefits or military service sections as well.

### Hypotheses 3
The baseline study will show that the current household information section is a pain point due to the order of the questions and the content supplying additional context.

**"Not enough information"**

- We did not have many participants who went through all of the household information flow elements including spouse and multiple dependents. 
- More participants in this study suggested they would not want to provide this information or it should be collected by other means.



## Key Findings

1. There were unfavorable perception towards providing certain information, specifically reporting income and insurance information.
2. There was confusion and missing information around the VA Benefits and Military Service questions.
3. The review pattern at the end of the application is easy-to-use to check answers and make changes prior to submitting.
4. Stopping points for information gathering occurred frequently around discharge papers (DD-214) and income or deductible information. 
5. Who qualifies as a dependent, that definition and general question confusion existed for participants who answered yes to having dependents. 


## Details of Findings 


### Finding 1
**Participants expressed unfavorable perceptions towards providing certain information, specifically reporting income and insurance information.**

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [TREND: Content]

There were parts of the application that participants expressed were unnecessary or that they should not have to provide this information as it should not impact the health care they qualify for. The information that applicants generally felt were unnecessary were around income and insurance. 

- 3/9 answered No on the Financial Disclosure page and would not want to share their income information when applying for healthcare.
- 3/10 participants mentioned pain points in the Insurance Information section and that they don't understand why they need to provide this information to apply.

*Income*
> No, I would not want to provide financial information for any reason. You get your check from the government, so they know how much you get anyways. (P4-15)

>  I think the VA should be for Veterans who can not afford insurance. Now disability is different then using the VA because if that is something you are entitled to you are entitled to it. Me, personally, am in a good financial situation so I would not provide that information because I want these funds to be used for those who are not. (P9-11)

> If you didn’t have your paperwork, but the IRS has it anyways, so they have it anyways. It tells you they will verify with the IRS anyways. So, in this case you don’t have to do it anyways. (P11-14)

> I just read this section here, they are saying this information is used to see what benefits are given. I make pretty good money, so I am now annoyed by that. I would probably not continue at this time because I would have to gather the information. Some of this stuff I would need to find a copy because someone them I do not have a copy. (P2-3)

Some participants noted the mention of IRS or verifying with and assumed they would have to upload or connect to their tax return or that this should be verifyied automatically and they should not have to provide on the application. 

> One thing I have had when it came to my tax returns, it made it so I could upload my tax returns from quicken into a website from the IRS website. It would have made this process easier if you could just sign into the website to just automatically link your tax return information to this website.(P12-15)

> If I were to upload my tax information would this auto populate? If it was there I would appreciate it because I already went through the trouble of uploading it so it would be nice if it did it. (P12-19)

> Yes, do we just have to download taxes? (goes back to first paragraph to read through)(P14-21)

> This just gets my goat. IRS is not nice word. (P2-20)


*Insurance*
> I don’t see it why putting the little bit of health insurance I get from my employer. Those two things should not meet. My other insurance should not be charged for anything. (P4-18)

> I will never agree with the insurance question, but that may just be me. They want to connect so they can charge my healthcare insurance for something they will not cover themselves. Is it fair they can tax onto my other insurance. (P4-37)



### Finding 2

**There was confusion and missing information around the VA Benefits and Military Service questions.**

Labels: [TREND: Content] 

Overall there was at least one question or more in this section that participants called out as needing clarification or simplification or that something was missing (often under the Military Service list). 

- 9/10 participants mentioned some parts of the VA Benefits or Military Service questions were confusing or that information was missing. 



*VA Benefits*
> There is just a lot of unnecessary information on here. I don’t know the difference between the compensation/pension. If they could just do a dropdown box, or even have a definition somewhere on the page telling us what the difference is. (P12-11)

*Military Service*
> Question on this one, should I just use my first retirement date? I went back on a recall after my first retirement date. You never know which date they want you to use. (P4-12)

> I'm confused because it tells me that I need to click all that apply, but none of those apply to me. I just want something that states 'none apply to me'. (P2-17)


*Missing information*
> At some point they will put in something about the burn pits too and stuff like that, the burn pits were awful for people. (P7-17) 

> I don’t see anything in regard to the burn pits. I would add that in there definitely. (P9-7)

> Right here it says up to 40% and above 50%, is there nothing between that? (P11-10)






### Finding 3

**The review pattern at the end of the application is easy-to-use when checking answers and making changes prior to submitting.**

Labels: [DSP: Form feedback], [DSC: Accordions]

Overall participants reacted favorably on the review page and were able to intuitively open, review and change their information as needed. 
There was one sugestion of being able to also upload their DD-214 on the review page.

- 8/10 participants mentioned that they could understand how to edit and review their information when on this page.
- 8/10 participants rated the review page 5/5 and the other 2 participants did not provide a rating at all, but provided positive comments. 
- 7/10 participants said there was no reason why they would submit the application on this review page. 

> It is great. It has all the information here for you, and if you need to fix a mistake it has the edit button here that you do not have to go back. (P9-15)

> Well, it says edits, so I would go ahead and edit it like that. Then I would update page and it changes it. (P7-29)

> 5, it is easy to use. If you have two brain cells you can fill it out. I really like that you can edit instead of going back through to correct something. (P1-34)

*Potential Pain Points*
> It brought over all the information from earlier. There is an edit button if you want to change anything. I don’t see an option to upload or change the document on this page. You should add that on this page. (P11-28)

> Say if I needed to go back to the financial part to verify I may not, but I would be worried because there is nothing here that says it would save my progress. (P12-25)

> No because it already did the upload papers, or if you haven’t uploaded your paperwork it would reject and not allow me to submit. Just right then don’t allow us to submit the application. (P4-26)


### Finding 4

**Stopping/pausing points for information gathering occurred frequently around discharge papers (DD-214) and income or deductible information.**

Labels: [DSP: Files], [PRDT: DD-214], [TREND: Content]

There were a few examples of information requested throughout the application that the participant said they need to step away to gather or that they would have to pasue for potentially days before continuing on with the application. 

- 5/10 participants said they would stop or pause because they would have to gather documents or figure out what login to use on the introduction page.
- 4/9 participants mentioned something was unclear or they had to pause here to get the document and information asked.  
- 2/7 participants mentioned the deductibles page as a pausing or stopping point.


> So far everything is pretty simple. I am assuming based on this statement that I have already applied to disability and have received a rating. If I tried to enroll in this without a rating. I want to go back and get into that.

*Upload file task / DD-214*
> It could take anywhere from 5 minutes or 5 days. I could have it in a safe or maybe I have a scanned copy somewhere in my email. If it were in my email 10 minutes, if I didn’t receive it yet it could take months. (P12-14) 

> I would have to contact the VA in St. Louis and request a copy of my DD-214. (P9-9) 

> Young veterans would be fine with this but idk you still have old veterans. They are eligible to use VA benefits but they don’t know what they qualify for or how to find it….my husband runs into a veteran who doesn’t re…these older people might not know how to do the technical part. (P14-18)



*Income and deductibles*
> It seems cut and dry. It does throws me off if this is worker’s comp. Now I have to round up more information on stocks, so it would make me want to go back and click on that I do not want to provide this information. (P2-21)

> Depending on sites if they have the information available. Maybe 20 minutes. (P13-12)

> This is enough information to get me started. The only thing I would need to look at is this gross household income because that would be through my husband. (P14-6)

> I would need clarity on this one because are they just talking college? I sometimes attend different events to future my education for my career. I attend other things that I would considered educational. I am taking an educational course on Google Sheets, so would that count? (P2-25)



 
### Finding 5

**Who qualifies as a dependent, that definition and general question confusion existed for participants who answered yes to having dependents.**

Labels: [TREND: Content] 

The participants mental models of who a dependent is or who a dependent considers a dependent impacted this question understanding as there was no additional explanation or context to guide them.  
- 4/4 participants were confused on who qualifies for a dependent or their was a question that was not clear. (out of 4 - short form participant and those who answered yes for dependents)
- 1/4 participant mentioned the time and effort to gather dependent information especailly Social Security Numbers if somebody had multiple dependents.
- 3/4 participants mentioned confusion on the annual income page where it had fields to enter their dependents income.


> That is just an odd question. I feel there should be a N/A option because that is stating that you do have a dependent between that age frame. If you click no or N/A you should not have to fill in a dollar amount. (P11-17)

> I grew up thinking a dependent is a kid, but my ex-wife is a dependent by military standards. (P1-24)

> Old military dependent. I have a 19-year-old so she is over the age of dependent but she can be on Tricare until she is 25. Now they say family member they don’t say dependent. It made me pause because I was used to being a dependent for so long. (P14-22)

> I am curious, you should have a checkbox that says they became your dependent on the same day as birth. I do understand why that is there in case you adopted or have a stepchild. (P12-17)



## Additional Insights

**1. Most participants indicated they would sign in or create an account prior to completing the application**

- 10/10 participants said they would sign in or create an account to complete the application.

> I have ID.me so I would use that to start the application. I have signed into the site, but not recently. (P9-2)

> It said at the bottom to sign in to start the application so I would click that to start my application. I am assuming that it is connected to all the normal logins so I could use the normal sign ins.(P4-4)

**2. Introduction page made participants feel prepared but some had additional suggestions.**

- 10/10 participants commented that the start application introduction page was easy but 4/10 had minor suggestions to make the page more clear.

> I would recommend that this section right here, you may enroll in healthcare if this is true. I would say to move this to the top and bolding the entire the whole statement or it may be glossed over like I did. If that is separated you it would be more clear that you just have to meet one of the requirements rather then all of them. (P1-4)

> I would want to see how this would work with my private health insurance on this page. (P2-5)
  
**3. Participants called out the birth sex question and expectation of having gender identity options to choose from here or on another page.**

- 5/10 participants commented that the birth sex question was an issue and that they expected to be given other gender options.

> no, not me, somebody might have a problem with there only being two genders. i am used to seeing the other option. (P12-6)

> Unless there were two questions where one says what you were assigned as birth and then another that says what do you identify as because if someone is applying for mental health issues and that had anything to do with it, they would need to know.
(P14-10)

>  This bothers me because I am transgender so I would like more options than just male or female. I would hope later they would ask our pronouns instead of what our gender at birth is.(P1-15)


**4. Participants generally struggled with some element of the facility selection question in the insurance information step.**

- 8/10 participant said they would want to search by proximity either by list or a search tool when chosing a VA location.
- 5/10 participants mentioned a pain point when choosing a facility in that they would want to decide by services or word-of-mouth or that it was difficult to search by facility names.


>  Just looking to pick a clinic you can pick all you want, but they will put you where they want. Why didn’t the system connect that I am a female that could not be seen at other clinics. (P4-20)

> Maybe if you could put in your location and they would tell you which clinics are close to you. It could help if it was in alphabetical order. If that could be built into this, because leaving and having to come back is not convenient. (P11-26)

> Was the list alphabetical? No, it is not. I started typing it in and it popped up. I think it would help to be alphabetical cause usually any dropdown menu is in alphabetical order. (14-30)

**5. Address questions in the Veteran Information section caused confusion among a couple of participants around selecting somewhere outside of the US or with what address to put first - their home or PO Box.**

*Address pain points 

> Okay so on state, I was born in Puerto Rico, it’s not going to ask me to type in Puerto Rico? It has the option of other but it doesn’t say like, sometimes you go on a site and another window would pop up where you could specify. Like it would say other and then I would type in Puerto Rico. (P14-8)

> Is a PO box an address or do you need a physical address? Sometimes anything that has an account number or anything personal I will send it to the PO box. Like if I put my PO Box would it pop up saying it needs a physical address? I can put my PO box and my physical address on the next line. I don’t know if that would create some confusion because I prefer the PO Box. But I am not getting a pop up so I am assuming they will send it to a PO Box.  (P14-11)


**6. Progress bar**

> I am still thrown off by step 1 of 6. I have gone through all this and I am still on step 1. I would think as I am clicking continue I would go through steps as I clicked. Maybe add an estimated time on how long it would take to fill out the form. Maybe label it step 1a, 1b…..(P2-13)





### Ratings and Post-Test Questions: 
#### Partipant Self-Reported Ratings

Participants asked on a scale of 1 - 5, 1 being non very poorly and 5 being very well.

![Participant Self-Reported Ratings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/2023-01-Baseline%20Task%20Research/images/ParticipantRatings.png)

#### Observer Ratings
Observer ratings of start application task completion using rating criteria:
- 0 = No part of the task completed, much difficulty
- 1 = Partial completion, much overlooked or task was difficult
- 2 = Partial completion, some areas were overlooked or task was slightly difficult
- 3 = Most of the task was completed with little difficulty
- 4 = All parts of the task were completed with no difficulty


![Observer Ratings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/2023-01-Baseline%20Task%20Research/images/ObserverRatings.png)




## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1
**Additional research on if any questions can be removed or simplified, plus authenticated flows and how much information can be pre-filled.**

- Research and discovery where utilizing additional “shortened form flows” to allow more applicants to skip providing some information where appropriate.
- Additional testing with authenticated users/flows to understand how pre-filled information changes the experience and expectations. 

> Key Finding 1: There was confusion or negative feelings around providing income and insurance information. 

> Key Finding 4: Stopping/pausing points for information gathering occurred frequently around discharge papers (DD-214) and income or deductible information.


### Recommendation 2
**Improve the usability of the income calculating questions by providing additional content explanation and exploring financial information prefills.**

- Review recent changes to financial disclosure and income pages currently in content review and add these findings for additional consideration.
- Discovery: what integrations, automations, and prefills can be incorporated for income calculation and how can these questions be aligned with the enrollment system. 
- Business/stakeholder questions for follow up: What are the downstream implications of not providing financial/household information? Slower time until decision for the Veteran because they have to supply this info anyways? Would this be an initially positive but long-term negative impact to the Veteran?


> Key Finding 1: There was confusion or negative feelings around providing income and insurance information. 


### Recommendation 3
**Clarification around dependents, who qualifies as a dependent and additional questions asked.**

- Implement recent household information section study content updates with additional information content for “Who does VA consider a dependent?”. 
- Research: can any of these questions be removed or simplified?

> Key Finding 5: Who qualifies as a dependent, that definition and general question confusion existed for participants who answered yes to having dependents.



### Recommendation 4
**Explore ways to make the facility selection page easier for participants to answer on that page without leaving and feeling confident they chose the location they will use.**

- Additional discovery on this page and how to best simplify and separate the existing 3 questions on the page: enrolling for Affordable Care Act, Selecting a VA facility, and being contacted regarding scheduling their first appointment.  

- Leverage learnings and designs from 10-10 CG application of facility selection updates.
 - [Improve Facility Selection Epic (CG)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/19433)
 - [Initiative brief(10-10CG)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/Improve%20Facility%20Selection/Improve%20Facility%20Selection%20-%20Initiative%20Brief.md)

> Additional insight 4: Participants generally struggled with some element of the facility selection question in the insurance information step.


### Recommendation 5
**Refinements to content in the military service section, including date clarification and review of the list of military services for accuracy and mapping each to Veteran impact or back-end processing needs.**

- Confirm if there is any missing information with the business/stakeholders for the military service list, refine content on the military service dates page to make it clear the task is for the last service period. 
- Business and user research on if this content is complete, clear and maps to positive outcomes for the Veteran and downstream for processing applications. 
- Do any of these situations result in additional short-form flow patterns? Ie. not needing to provide certain information on following sections/questions.


> Key Finding 2: There was confusion and missing information around the VA Benefits and Military Service questions.


### Recommendation 6
**Additional discovery on how to proceed with birth sex and gender identity questions.** 

- On paper SIGI is used for both the Veteran and Spouse, and birth sex is used only for the Veteran. 
- What is needed for enrollment only needs?

> Additional Insight 3: Participants called out the birth sex question and expectation of having gender identity options to choose from here or on another page.



### Recommendation 7
**Additional rounds of research targeting groups missed during this round, include a more holistic perspective of the possible paths that are often taken.**

- In future studies, recruit for participants not represented in this study and conduct studies that are both targeted and more free-form.   
- And include multiple cohorts/studies as needed when targeting groups to meet focused goals (example; recruit or use a scenario to follow if needing to gather feedback on dependents multiple responses pattern). 



## Next Steps

- Implement recent household information optimization content updates ([in progress now for review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/52920) and then FE) and then test in staging/production.
- Draft research plan for next round of testing, including how to balance targeted and representational user flows.  
- Content and business review of military service section, including clarification wording to dates and missing items in service list. 



## Further research needed

- Assistive technology users
