# Notification settings: User has no contact info on file
**Last updated: February 22, 2023**

LOA3 users who sign in, go to the profile, and click into the notification settings page can’t manage notifications if we don’t have relevant contact info in their profile.

## UX
We use the [warning alert component](https://design.va.gov/components/alert#warning-alert) to direct the user to the contact info section to provide the missing contact info.

Once they update their contact information, they'll be brought back to the notification settings page, where a success message will be displayed.
