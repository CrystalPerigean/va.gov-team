# Research Plan for OCTO Benefits Portfolio Support Team, April 11, 2023

## Background
- What problem is your product trying to solve?
We aim for our portfolio's products to get Veterans benefits in minutes, not months.

- Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
The main one we're interested in for this research: https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction

- What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?
Iteration on an existing one. Veterans submit ~1,500 disability claims per day through this tool.

### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims. This is one of ten OCTO objectives for 2023.

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

Getting out / starting up / taking care of myself (applying for disability compensation benefits)

## Research Goals   
What are you trying to learn from this research? 
This research is part of a larger, ongoing discovery effort to better understand the overall claimant experience. 
- Understand how Veterans conceptualize and experience the claims process
- Understand what frictions exist in the process that become burdensome for Veterans or sow mistrust.
- Identify the biggest pain points or opportunities for more focused research and problem solving.
- Build empathy so that teams align and focus on the mission.

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
- The portfolio teams are taking a step back to look at the big picture claims experience to see where the greatest opportunities lie to improve that experience, with special attention to a) overall speed, from application to award; b) building Veteran trust; and c) potential impacts of automation on those experiences (positive, negative, and unexpected).
- The team is expecting to build this body of knowledge over time, with quarterly visits to a geographical location that involves touchpoints with multiple stakeholders in the ecosystem, including claims processors and Veterans.
- We will share our learnings with the teams we support that work on the disability benefits application tool on VA.gov and with teams who work on automations to support claims processors. They will use these learnings to identify opportunities to focus on, including where to take a deeper-dive into research.

### Research questions

- How do Veterans describe the process of applying for benefits? In their mind, what were the steps of the process?
- What was their experience at different points of the process? What did they do? What touchpoints did they have with the VA. How did they feel?
- What parts of the claim process were positive, and why? What parts were negative, and why? 
- What parts of the claim experience build trust with Veterans? What breaks it?
- What motivated them to start the process? Are they glad they went through it?
- What do they think needs the most improvement?

Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/abd-vro/2023-04-site-visit/veteran-claims-exp-discussion-guide.md)

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

Our hypothesis is that there will be significant areas of friction in the claims process that can be improved to make a faster, better claims experience that builds Veteran trust. 
We expect that Veterans are skeptical going into the application process, but if we can make the process easier and quicker, we can help create feelings of trust and pride.

## Methodology  
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research.
We want to have somewhat open-ended conversations with Veterans to explore ideas we may not yet have encountered and leave room for unexpected insights.

Additional resources:
- Please review the [PRA primer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/what-is-paperwork-reduction-act.md) to educate yourself on how PRA impacts the research we do as a government project. 
- Review the [Perigean recruitment guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Recruiting-Participants.1958773044.html) to understand how Perigean recruits, and what types of research they can support.

## Recruitment  

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 
- Audience: Veterans
- Recruiter: Perigean

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? Maximum variation sampling.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 
- 4 Veterans

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 
- All participants should have completed a disability compensation benefits application that included at least one new condition via VA.gov. 

**Note 1**: Veteran must have **submitted their claim online** via va.gov. It is not enough to use va.gov to download the paper application. 

**Note 2**: A new condition is one for which the Veteran has no rating; i.e., one they are claiming for the first time. A condition could be any health condition (asthma, hypertension, cancer, knee injury, etc.)

    - 2 Veterans should have completed this application in the past 6 months
    - 2 Veterans should have completed this application in the past 7-18 months

**Demographics:**
- Even mix of rural and urban (prefer East/Southeast but not required)
- Even mix of genders
- At least 3 participants are persons of color
- All persons are under age 55
- Mix of education levels attained but no more than 2 with college or higher degree
- 1 person who identifies as having a cognitive disability

**Recruiting questions**
1. Have you ever submitted a claim or application for disability compensation benefits on va.gov? You must have submitted it online, not mailed or faxed it, to answer yes [answer YES to CONTINUE]
2. When did you complete that application? [READ OPTIONS; Veteran may answer more than one option, but must answer either a or b to CONTINUE]
    - a. In the past 6 months (since Oct 1, 2022) [RECRUIT 2]
    - b. In the past 7-18 months (Between Apr 1, 2021 and Sep 30, 2022) [RECRUIT 2]
    - c. Between 18 and 24 months ago (between Oct 1, 2020 and Mar 30, 2021) [HOLD, may accept if needed to fill the study]
    - d. More than 24 months ago (Before Oct 1, 2020) [If only answer, thank and DISCONTINUE]

3. In that application, did you claim at least one NEW condition? A new condition is one that you have never claimed before and was not already service connected or denied. [answer YES to CONTINUE]

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 
None

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.
