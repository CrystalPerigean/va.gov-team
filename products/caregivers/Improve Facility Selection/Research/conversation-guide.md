## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [MODERATOR NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about one particular question that is on the application for Family Caregiver Benefits.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take less than 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 



## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.


**For Veterans:**
- What kind of benefits or services do you use the VA for?
- Do you have a preferred VA facility/location?
- Do you currently have a caregiver? 
- Does your caregiver receive any benefits from the VA - are you/they part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers? 
- Do you have more than one caregiver? 


**For Caregivers:**
- Does the Veteran you are a caregiver for receive benefits and services from the VA?
- Do you receive any benefits from the VA? 
    - Are you part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers?
- Do you or your Veteran have a preferred VA facility/location?
- Tell me a bit about the caregiver relationship you have with the Veteran. 
    - Are they a family member or friend?
- Does the Veteran have more than one caregiver? 



## First Task - 10 minutes

- You are completing the application for caregiver benefits and after you answer general background questions on the Veteran (like name and address) you arrive at this page. Please explain your thoughts and think-aloud as you complete the questions on this page.

> Link for prototype 

- How would you prefer to search for facilities?

- Was anything on those pages unclear or you would like additional information on?

- From this prototype, can you explain to me how your location choice is part of the caregiver application process?
 
- Let's imagine you want to change the location you have selected - you are moving soon - by doing a new search. Can you walk me through how you would accomplish that?



### Things to watch for:
- [Does the participant comment that they would need clarifying information to answer the question?]
- [Does the participant search by zip code, city or state]
- [Does the particpant comment or react to the confirmation screen?]
- [Does the confirmation screen add confusion for the participant?]






## Post task questions - 5 minutes

Wonderful! I have a few questions about the site you just interacted with.

- Was there anything that stood out to you?
- Did you feel the most confident in answering the questions with no additional clarification needed?
- Do you need any clarifying informaiton about how the answer you provide will be used in the caregiver application process?



 
## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
