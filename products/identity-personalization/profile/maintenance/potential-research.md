# Profile: potential research

Last updated: March 21, 2023

This document serves to capture smaller updates we've made to profile that probably don't warrant their own research study, but should be evaluated as we have the opportunity in larger studies.

## Profile wide

### Learn how our new "update info as sub-task pattern" works for people

This was incorporated in the code-pen prototypes for [notification settings research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/notification-preferences/discovery-and-research/usability-study-add-email-jan-2023), but it would be helpful to get another round of research to validate it when people are on the actual website.

#### Research questions
- Do people understand the update was made if we continue using the background only alert banner?
- Does this work across different parts of profile (I think we only currently have a use case for it for contact info > notification settings)?
- Does this pattern work for updating profile information in the middle of a form flow?

## Contact information

### Improving clarity of content for email addresses

- **Release date**: 9/18/21

#### Research questions

- Do people understand the difference between sign-in and contact email addresses?
- Do people hesitate to update/remove their contact email address because they think they won't be able to sign in?

## Military information
TBD
