# My VA: Benefit Applications Drafts Use Cases

**Last updated:** April 13, 2023

## Overview of Benefit Application Drafts:

- For all of these use cases, the user must be LOA3 (identity verified). All LOA3 users will see this section on My VA.
- [LOA1 users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/use-cases/LOA1-use-cases) will not see this section on My VA.
- This feature on My VA contains an expandable dropdown with a list of VA benefits links.
- This feature shows a card for any benefit applications that a user has started and saved but not yet submitted, or text stating that the user has no benefit application drafts.

## Common use cases:

- [User has a benefit application draft saved but not yet submitted](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/use-cases/benefit-application-drafts-use-cases.md/user-has-applications-drafts.md)
- [User has no benefit application drafts saved](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/use-cases/benefit-application-drafts-use-cases.md/user-has-no-application-drafts.md)

## Edge cases:

### System:
The data for saved applications is gathered from the same API as the main user call. Therefore, there are no errors specific to just this section. If the main user call fails, the entire My VA page displays an error.
