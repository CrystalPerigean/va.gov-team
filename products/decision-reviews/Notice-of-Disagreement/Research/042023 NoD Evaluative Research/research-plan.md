# Research Plan for Board Appeals
This work is the first of three products to undergo evaluation as part of the decision review pathway for veterans looking to increase their disability rating. For a summary of the three products and information gathered, visit the  [Decision Review Mural Board](https://app.mural.co/t/coforma8350/m/coforma8350/1679600983883/c565af371b4772fe601b1ab9df7a4a8212b7f7e9?sender=u9f0bb2ec659271ca596a3678) (sign-in required).

## Background
Veterans can file a request for a board appeal if they are dissatisfied or disagree with a VA decision on their benefits claim in hopes of receiving a higher benefits rating. The Request for Board Appeal online form was released in April 2022 and hasn’t received a post-launch review of the feature. The focus of this qualitative study is to evaluate the usability and learn what decision led veterans to choose the board appeal pathway over the others.

### OCTO Priorities
Improvements we intend to make will satisfy the following priorities: 

* Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

Along with meeting OCTO priorities, we are working with the Board of Appeals to discover ways we can help meet the following goals:

* Each Veteran’s appeal is timely docketed and tracked throughout the appeals process
* Each Veteran receives a timely hearing by a Veterans Law Judge upon request
* Each Veteran receives a timely decision on his/her appeal\

### Veteran Journey
Services and products coming out of this effort would support the following phases of a veteran’s journey:  Taking Care of Myself, Retiring, Aging  and Putting down roots, specifically engaging VA to access benefits and services in the  [Veteran Journey Map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) .

## Research Goals
1. Understand the Veteran’s experience of the current digital form, identify possible usability issues within the form.
2. Understand the Veteran’s reason for choosing to apply for a Board Appeal as opposed to the other two decision review pathways.
3. Understand the Veteran’s reason for choosing a hearing type.

### Outcomes
We will use the research findings to establish a baseline for measuring the effectiveness of the Request a Board Appeal digital form experience, including:
* Identifying ways to increase usability and veterans’ confidence
* Understanding why veterans select specific hearing types
* Identifying opportunities to improve the content for Decision Reviews

### Research questions
1. What is the emotional experience like for Veterans looking to submit a request for board appeal?
2. Are Veterans able to submit a fully developed request for a board appeal online form? 
	* What are the areas of friction and pain points that exist within the current form?
3. Is the content provided sufficient in helping them progress through the form?
	* How confident are Veterans in filling out the form and understanding the process after submission?
4. How helpful is the current content on va.gov for Veterans choosing between decision reviews?
	* What information are veterans looking for when self-servicing?
	* Do users understand the difference between a denial and disagreement, and how does it affect their confidence in choosing a decision review? 
5. Would giving veterans the ability to review and save a copy of their form provide any value for them?

### Hypotheses

1. We believe Veterans do not understand what is needed from them to gain favorable judgment.
2. We believe that Veterans submitting a Request for Board Appeal have considered the other two disagreement pathways before moving forward with the application.
3. We believe that the content provided about the Request for Board Appeal before, during, and after the application sets reasonable expectations for Veterans about the timeline and process.
4. We believe that Veterans are confused about the deadlines for submission, and issues they can request a board appeal for.
5. We believe that the updates to the paper form that are missing from the digital form may be preventing Veterans from successfully completing a Board Appeal request
6. We believe Veterans desire a copy of the form once it’s submitted digitally

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html)  8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it’s ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a  [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html) .
A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.
