## Research Goals
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These Credential Service Providers (CSPs) don't meet required security standards and having so many choices creates user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov as a first choice or ID.me. During discovery research, the LGA team defined different pathways for the migration.
Test the usability of a modal prototype that encourages veterans to signup for a login.gov account
Identify which terms are most understandable and resonate most when describing identity concepts like verified (ID prooded) account and authentication.
Find out best ways to encourage more veterans to migrate CSPs now, even before sunsetting of legacy accounts(s)

## Research Questions
Is the modal useful in encouraging organic adoption of a modern CSP?
Would any changes make the modal more helpful or more encouraging?
What word or phrase will best convey to veterans the concept of “ID proof” or “verified account”?
How might we encourage more veterans to migrate their CSP now, on their own, before sunsetting forces it?

## Methodology
We conducted remote usability testing to evaluate a modal prototype with participants who access VA.gov via mobile devices. This was paired with interview questions to evaluate the use of words and phrases to best convey account and sign in concepts to veterans.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans will have a term or phrase for identity concepts like “verified account” that we can use to better speak to the process.
   - **Partly True** - most participants understood identity concepts, but there wasn't clear coalescing around specific terms
2. Most veterans will not understand how CSPs are different from their account
   - **Mostly True** - Some participants understand Login.gov as credentialing, but especially those unfamiliar with Login.gov understood it as a new place to access their VA information 
3. Some veterans will be motivated to migrate from a legacy CSP with encouragement from the modal prototype
   - **Mostly False** - A few participants expressed openness to changing CSPs and an interest in learning more about this change. However all wanted to keep their current CSP giving the information in this modal, and some also expressed the 20 minutes would be too long of a commitment in the moment
4. Most veterans will choose to ignore the modal their first time seeing it
   - **Definitely True** - most participants found the modal immediately after sign in to be a nuisance interrupting the task at hand and wanted to get past it.
5. Older Veterans will be less likely to set up a Login.gov account from their mobile device as compared with a laptop or desktop computer
   - **True** - Many participants preferred to use a computer to update accounts or complete complex tasks, citing larger text, easier typing, and the ability to see different windows side-by-side
6. Most veterans will choose to continue to use their current (legacy) credential unless they have no other choice for logging in to access their benefits online.
   - **Mostly True** - Veterans are unlikely to switch to a new credential after using theirs for many years without issue. Veterans are also apprehensive about using a single sign on for multiple gov accounts since some experienced issues causing them to lose access for several days.

## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

**Recruitment criteria**

This study recruited for mobile users, with a recent sign in to the VA online. We were particularly interseted in veterans who sign in using DSLogon or My HealtheVet login CSPs. For diversity and inclusion (based on gaps of two recent identity related studies) we requested veterans with cognitive disability, 
who are LGBTQ+, and who have immigrant origin. Unfortunately we didn't talk with anyone with immigrant origin, but recruitment surpassed our request with cognative disability and LGBTQ+ participants.

Note: while we didn't specify recruitment goals for age, it so happened that all of this studies participants are 55+

We talked to **14 participants.**
