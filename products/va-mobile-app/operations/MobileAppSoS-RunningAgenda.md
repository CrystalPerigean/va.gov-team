## Notes

5/9/23

Sprint Demo meeting  - is there a better time slot?

EVSS Migration - data discrpencies
  * New claims Status data source does not include the VA Representative (removed because it was misleading)
  * We have concerns about removing it from the Claims tool in the app because there is no where else that provides this information.  
  * We could use help understanding how VA.gov made the decision to remove it

-----------------

5/2/23

Preferred Name & Gender Go/Live  on hold
  * Team currently troubleshooting, lag in update identified in during UAT.  Requires multiple update attempts to populate Preferred Name & Gender Identity issue #[5548](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/5548) 

Secure Messaging - MHV Re-engineering SM PAtient APIs & Mobile having to migrate  
  * This is completely separate work than the Secure Messaging Alignment (copy, attachment, categories, etc) work 
  * Late March MHV notified Mobile that they are re-engineering APIs for Secure Messaging Patient APIs - no functionality changes just moving to a new platform 
  * This requires Mobile to migrate to these APIs on the new platform in order to keep Secure Messaging functioning (May 31st is when MHV targeted their work completed ; Needed Mobile to migrate by 8/22) 
  * Given this mobile is entirely dependent on MHV as it's their APIs that need to be completed 
  * Informed last week that this timing may be at risk - no timeline given - delays some Q2 planned capacity (BE mainly) till later into Q2 and likely early Q3 
  * Next step is to meet with them in June 
  * I made this a separate item above   

Digital Decision Letters
  * All set to go live 5/9
  * Notifying VBA stakeholders

Figma Shipped Files
  * Ryan curious the effort we put into Design Ops tasks
    * VA.gov doesn't do the same process
    * We are putting more effort in right now but it won't always be this effort-heavy, going forward designs will go from working files into Shipped files.  We just need to build them out to start right now.
    * Ryan curious if there is a way to use the Shipped Files in Figma with his Data Dictionary work he is doing

-----------------

4/25/23
Discussion Items 
* Experience and worked through resource constraints in Sprint 69 
  * Overcame this challenge through positive team work and communicaiton - great job team!! 
* What's New in-app UI - what threshold do we want to use for utilization of the What's New alert on the app Home screen?
  * We will put both DDL and PNGI into the What's New Alert for this release.
* Pulling in Check-In Discover into Sprint 70 
  * This work was not planned for Sprint 70 so pulling it in means we need to remove work to compensate for the infusion of capacity to perform this work 
  * Need POs to decide what gets pulled out, we would recommened Secure Messaging Alignment and Claims Step 2 work 
  * Also may need to pull out work from Sprint 71 and 72 to compensate 
  * Expected lift for Check-in in this Sprint is lower than originally thought.  Health team to reevaluate if anything needs to be pulled out.
* More info coming later about the effort to put up Smart Banners on VA.gov to help drive people to use the mobile app.


-----------------
4/18/23
* Resource constraints on FE team have caused concerns for both DDL and WCAG features being wrapped up this Sprint
  * Should be more cognizant of capacities in Sprint Planning
* RX - MHV team making a change tonight related to tracking prescriptions
  * Rachel & Ryan - we need help understanding if this requires changes for us.  If so, we need to discuss timing as we can't match their release (tonight)
  * Currently we get tracking info from CMOP - not sure if this change is adding to this or something different
  * New content disclosure needs to be displayed?
* RX Research concluded, findings and recommendations to come
