## Intro - 5-10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Robyn/Jonathan and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, I'll talk a little bit about what we'll be asking you today.  

We are part of a team working on the health sections of website VA.gov. We’d like to get your feedback on some changes we have made to how you can access your personal health information and benefits on VA.gov. Specifically, we'll be asking you to perform a set of tasks that show how you would navigate the VA.gov website to access and manage health-related information and benenfits. Most of what we'll be asking you is about your reactions to what you see on the website and where you might expect things to be. We won't ask you for personal information about your own benefits - we'll focus on your thoughts on the changes we've made to the VA.gov website. 

**For screenreader or mobile sessions:** Before we start, I want to confirm a few pieces of information that were shared with me when you signed up for the study:
- **For screenreader sessions:** I understand you use screenreader software to navigate the internet, and that you typically use SOFTWARE NAME.  Can you confirm you’ll be using that in today’s session?
- **For mobile sessions:** I understand you use your smartphone primarily to access VA.gov. Can you confirm that you are on your phone now? 

Thank you for confirming these things! Now, I have a few things about today I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stope the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know. 
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow peopel to observe this interview, but I want to double check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

 
## Warm-up Questions - 5-10 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)*

2. *(If using assistive technology:)* How would you rate your level of experience with using [specific assistive technology, such as a screen reader]--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?

	- *(If using assistive technology:)* How long have you been using [specific assistive technology]?

3. What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA? 

## Screen sharing instructions

I'm going to ask you to do a couple things on the VA website, VA.gov, and to share your screen so I can see how you navigate on the website. Do you know how to share your screen? 

_Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:_
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

_Instructions for folks using screenreaders on a desktop:_
- Hit Alt S (as in Same); the option should come up to select the window you want to share - please choose Basic. 
- Tab over and confirm that what is selected is "entire screen." 
- Tab once more - make sure "share sound" is checked. 
- Tab 4 times over to "share screen" - click activate. 


Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.


- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Usability testing - 40-50 minutes

4. _Starting from [new home page](https://www.va.gov/new-home-page/):_ Using VA.gov, if you wanted to send a message to your doctor to follow up about a question you had in a previous appointment, how would you go about doing that? 
	- _Nudge and probe as appropriate. If get totally lost, help them out. Ultimately, need them to sign in._

	- _Optional alternative approach:_ There is a new section where you can find all of your personal health information, like your messages with your doctor and your personal health records. _(If person is MHV user, let them know that we are moving MHV onto VA.gov.)_ 
	- Starting from this home page, how would you find this new page with all your personal health information?

5. _Once the person arrives at landing page:_ Why don't you spend a little time getting to know this page. Please think out loud and let me know what your thoughts are about the page, the information here, and how everything is organized. 
 	- _After they've moseyed about:_ What do you think this space is? 

6. What do you believe you are supposed to be able to do here? 

7. What would you expect to be able to do or find if you clicked on the link "Download my medical record (Blue Button)"? _(Read Health Records section options aloud for participants using screenreaders to save them having to find the section.)_

8. What about "Health history" - what do you think you would find if you clicked on that link?

_Optional questions to try out:_

	- Where would you go to find a record of your vaccines?
	- Where would you go to find a progress note that your doctor wrote during a recent visit?
	- How would you get a copy of your entire medical record?

9. If you needed to get paid back by the VA for having to drive a long distance to a VA medical center for an appointment, where would you go to submit the receipts to be paid back? 

10. If you needed to see a healthcare provider outside of the VA and you wanted to see if that would still be covered by your VA benefits, how would you figure that out? 
	- What do you think the My VA health benefits section includes? What is this section "about"?

11. _For users who are familiar with MHV:_ How is this site different than MHV? 

12. _For users who receive other benefits from the VA:_ Where do you currently go to access and manage your benefits? (_If user does not use the VA.gov website to access and manage their benefits:_ If you were to access and manage your benefits on VA.gov, where would you go?) 
	- Would you expect to access your other benefits from this page or somewhere else on the VA.gov website? 
	
	- _For users who do not receive other benefits from the VA:_ If you had benefits, would you expect to access those benefits from this page or somewhere else on the VA.gov website? 

13. What information did you expect to see on this landing page but don't? 

14. Many of these links take you elsewhere, like back to MHV. Is that what you expected? How do you feel about that? 
	- Would you have expected to be told if a link took you out of this area? 

15. _Optional question:_ What do you want to be able to do on this page? How would you go about trying to do that?

16. If you wanted to be reminded that you have an appointment, that would require setting that up as a "preference." How would you go about doing that? 
	- _Probe for whether this should be in Profile or somewhere health-specific._ 

17. What about if you wanted to sign up to track you prescription refills, like you can on Amazon - where would you go to sign up to do that? 
	- _Probe for whether this should be in Profile or somewhere health-specific._ 

18. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?
