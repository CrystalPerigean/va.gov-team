## CARD SORT - 20 minutes 

- Okay, great. Let's go ahead and get started - **I'll start with sharing my screen.**  

[PULLS UP OPTIMAL SORT]

**[CARD SORT - PARTICIPANT CARDS]** 

If you were to log in to VA.gov today, what kinds of notifications would you want to see? We can write them down on these cards together. 

**[CARD SORT - ADDING CARDS]** 

On these cards that you can see here, we have a few potential action items that you might see on VA.gov. Go ahead and read through these. If you can think of any additional action items that you might want to see, let's go ahead an make cards for them. 

**[CARD SORT - SORTING]** 

So now that we have all of the potential action items that you'd like to see - let's sort these by priority. 

We'll make three columns: High, Medium, and Low priority. 

**Feel free to think out loud as you work through the exercise.**

[QUESTIONS]

- Ok, looking at theses categories, do you feel like they work for you?
- Let's take a look at the high priority column - why did you put these updates in that column?
    - What makes an update 'High priority' to you? 
- Let's take a look at the low priority column - why did you put these updates in that column?
    - What makes an update 'Low priority' to you? 
- So if you could imagine a page with all of these updates, how could you tell which ones are high priority vs low priority? 
- Any additional thoughts or questions?
