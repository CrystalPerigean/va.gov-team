## Research Goals
Based on the previous tree test findings, the team iterated on the information architecture for the health hub and health apartment. As the team considers how to properly include the Health Apartment on VA.gov to ensure Veterans and Caregivers to get and manage their health care benefits, this research will help inform decisions on the information architecture of the health apartment and how it links to the broader VA.gov structure.

Veteran tasks fit in the following key points in the Veteran journey:
- Primary – Starting up and Taking care of myself
- Secondary – Putting down roots, Retiring, Aging

The goal of this research is to gather quantitative insights on the findability of more detailed and deeper tasks within the proposed IA of the My health patient portal experience.

In these tree tests, we will aim to:
- Evaluate the findability of various information within the "My Health" structure
- Evaluate where participants look for information related to their health records between "Appointments", "Health history", and "Medical records"


## Research Questions

Can Veterans navigate the proposed information architecture of the My health patient portal in order to find information and complete tasks related to managing their health?


## Methodology 

- We utilized Optimal Workshop's Treeejack tool to conduct unmoderated sessions with Veterans
- This tool allows us to collect data on how participants navigate a menu structure to find the answers to questions/tasks
- Participants were asked to complete 10 tasks by navigating a menu structure and indicating where they would be able to find the answer
- Participants were started at the top of the menu for each task with the menu fully collapsed
- Tasks were randomized to avoid bias from learning the tree as the test progressed

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypotheses or tasks for this research along with the conclusions you found If you conducted a usability test, list the success or task completion rate._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)_

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_

**Veterans will understand what types of information can be found in the “Test results”, "Health history" and "Medical records" sections.**
- Likely true, see finding 1

**Veterans will understand that the "Medications" section includes all of their prescription information - current and past.**
- Definitely true, see finding 3

**Veterans will look for appointment follow-up tasks and information within the "Appointments" section.**
- Maybe true, see finding 2


**Veterans will easily find general information and tasks related to their VA health benefits within the "My health benefits" grouping.**

## Key Findings


1. The different sections containing health and medical records information had some overlap in meaning, but were still successful tasks
2. The “Appointments” section was not the primary place Veterans looked for post-appointment tasks such as travel pay or after-visit summaries 
3. Veterans looked for both current and past prescription information within the “Medications” section
4. It is unknown if Veterans understand what to expect within the “My health benefits” section
5. The placement and labeling of “vitals” is not entirely clear to Veterans
6. While most Veterans successfully found vaccine information, Veterans who are current MHV users had slightly more success than those that are not current


## Details of Findings 



**Finding 1: The different sections containing health and medical information have some overlap in meaning, but were still successful tasks**

- We tested 5 items related to health and medical information that were placed within the 3 separate areas – Test results, Health history, and Medical records
- While most Veterans navigated to and selected answers in the correct section, there was consistently a small number of participants that navigated to the “Medical records” section for these tasks

_Highlighted and bold indicates the preferred path; Blank indicates <2%_

**Hypothesis**: Veterans will understand what types of information can be found in the “Test results”, "Health history“, and "Medical records" sections

**Related tasks**:
2) You saw your primary care provider last month and want to review what was decided for next steps in your care.
5) You want to find the results of a recent MRI you had done.
6) You need to know when you had your last tetanus shot.
7) You want to know what your blood pressure was the last time you had it taken at a VA medical facility.
8) You want to get a copy of your VA health records for your personal files.




**Finding 2: The “Appointments” section was not the primary place Veterans looked for post-appointment tasks such as travel pay or after-visit summaries**

- Veterans primarily navigated to and selected answers in areas other than “Appointments”,  however there was still a significant number of Veterans that navigated to “Appointments” for these tasks 
- Veterans not enrolled in VA health care were twice as likely to look in “Appointments” than Veterans currently enrolled in VA health care
- For the after-visit summary task, over 50% of Veterans correctly selected the “After-visit summary” option in either “Health history” or “appointments”, indicating there is likely some understanding or familiarity with that label
- Notes: Travel pay is not available within appointments in today's VA.gov or MHV experience

_Bold indicates the majority path_

**Hypothesis**: Veterans will look for appointment follow-up tasks and information within the "Appointments" section – including travel pay and after-visit summaries

**Related tasks**: 
1. You drove to see your VA primary care physician and want to get paid back for the cost of gas.
2. You saw your primary care provider last month and want to review what was decided for next steps in your care.




**Finding 3: Veterans looked for both current and past prescription information within the “Medications” section**

- For this round of testing, the label of the previous “Prescriptions” section was changed to “Medications” to better encompass all of the prescribed and over the counter medications that patients may be taking
- Over 74% of all Veterans looked to the “Medications” section to find information on both current and past prescriptions
- There was a small percentage of Veterans that looked in “Health history” for information on an old prescription

**Hypothesis**: Veterans will understand that the "Medications" section includes all prescription information - current and past.

**Related tasks**: 
3. You need to request a refill for a prescription you get from VA by mail.
4. You want to know the name of the prescription that you stopped taking last summer for a skin condition.



**Finding 4: It is not clear if Veterans understand what to expect within the “My health benefits” section**

-There were only 2 tasks – travel pay and veteran health ID card – where a notable number of Veterans navigated to and made selections in the “My health benefits” section (>4% visited or made a selection) 
- Veteran health ID card was placed in this section, and saw a high success rate
- This section also contains general benefit information, which in previous tests also indicated some level of challenge, and will need continued evaluation

**Hypothesis**: Veterans will easily find general information and tasks related to their VA health benefits within the "My health benefits" grouping.

**Related tasks**: 
1. You drove to see your VA primary care physician and want to get paid back for the cost of gas.
10. You recently lost your ID card for your Veteran health care and need to get a new one.



**Finding 5: The placement and labeling of “vitals” is not entirely clear to Veterans**

Labels: label 1, label 2 

_List all labels that apply to this finding from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

- Veterans were somewhat divided in where they first looked - “Test results” and “Health history” 
- Most Veterans selected answers within “Health history”, although 1/3 of them were incorrect indicating that “vitals” may not be entirely clear (i.e. Veterans may not know what is and is not a “vital”)
- Current MHV has vitals as a separate option from both “Labs and tests” and “Health history”
- This could be a result of a label, placement, or phrasing of the question and this topic will benefit from gaining qualitative feedback from Veterans

**Hypothesis**: Veterans will understand what types of information can be found in the “Test results”, "Health history" and "Medical records" sections

**Related tasks**:
7. You want to know what your blood pressure was the last time you had it taken at a VA medical facility.


**Finding 6: While most Veterans successfully found vaccine information, Veterans who are current MHV users had slightly more success than those that are not current**

- Veterans with MHV experience were more successful in this task, possibly due to it being a similar placement and label as the current MHV experience
- Initial clicks were divided equally between “Health history” and “Medical records” for all Veteran participants
- A small number of Veterans who are not current MHV users navigated to and selected answers in “Medications” and “Test results”
- There is nothing to indicate that the “vaccines” label was not clear since most Veterans ultimately selected that answer

**Hypothesis**: Veterans will understand what types of information can be found in the “Test results”, "Health history" and "Medical records" sections

**Related tasks**:
6. You need to know when you had your last tetanus shot.


## Additional Insights

_Any additional insights that aren't "key findings." These can be powerful comments from users that don’t represent a pattern in this study, but may be part of one outside this study._


## Recommendations

_Put together initial recommendations here based on your findings along with supporting evidence. Review with your team, then edit as needed._

- Slot travel pay in a more prominent position within the IA, and continue to crosslink from past appointments
- Continue to refine the “Care notes and summaries” section as we learn more about the types of clinical notes, and consider an approach similar to labs and tests which doesn’t rely on Veterans to know the types and differences of various documents
- Continue to refine the options in “Health history” to make them more clear and understandable
- Move to qualitative research to gain further insights and feedback



## Next Steps

Finalize labeling and structure for core features based on test results and build into designs 
- In progress and will be worked into ongoing design efforts

Move to qualitative research to gain further insights and feedback and refine 
–  Additional research will be incorporated into product design cycles for each feature/tool

Continue to build out and test IA to support additional features
- Methodology and timing TBD based on needs

**Recruitment criteria**

6 cohorts of 9 Veterans were recruited - 45 completed and were included in results
- 23 have used MHV in last 12 months
- 22 have not used MHV in the last 12 months (not required to have VA health care)
54 attempted,  10 abandoned, 4 were removed from results (1 duplicate, 2 non-participatory, 1 high invalid responses)

- Participants recruited represented a diverse sample of Veterans composed of varying ages, races, genders, geographical locations, education levels, and cognitive abilities.
- Optimal workshop does not currently support assistive screen readers, so participants that utilize assistive tech were not recruited in this test.
