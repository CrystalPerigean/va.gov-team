## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Ruben and I'll be facilitating the session today.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about disability compensation claims in VA.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [1 hour].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability, and I did not design what we are looking at today. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

Ok, we're going to start with a few warm-up questions.

- What do you typically use VA.gov for? 
- How long have you been using VA.gov?
- Do you interact with the VA in other ways â€“ in person, on the phone?
- Do you currently have a claim in progress on VA.gov? (They should.)
- About how long ago did you file this claim?

## CST Review - 30 minutes

- [Logging into CST] Are you familiar with this page?
- Tell me what you see here.
- What do you think is the status of your claim?
- On a scale of 1-5, how clear would you say the status of this claim is?  
- Is there any action that you think you need to take here? What makes you think that?
- Do you have a clear sense of what other actions will be required from you as this claim goes through the review process? Why or why not?
- Did you do a C&P exam as part of the claim process? If yes, how did you know that you had to do that? 
- What is the most confusing part of this web page?
- What is the most helpful part of this web page? 

## Co-Design Exercise - 15 minutes

- [Share Mural board] Let's take a look at this Mural board. You can see here we have a blank slate of the screens we just saw. 
- Here you can see some sticky notes. Looking at this page, can you tell me what information you would most want to see on this page?
- [Repeat for all 4 pages of CST]
- Now that we have these ideas, let's rearrange them in order of importance. Which of these would be the most important, or the one that you would want to be near the top? Second? Third?
- [Repeat for all 4 pages of CST]

### Things to watch for:

- Is the participant familiar with CST? 
- Do they seem to recognize what CST is trying to tell them about the status of their claim?
- What are the biggest frustrations or concerns demonstrated by the participant when interacting with CST?

### Things to watch for:

- How helpful is the abbreviated version of the decision review options screen vs. the longer format page?
- How comfortable do participants feel pursuing a decision review option at this point? How informed do they feel?
- Do participants understand the differences between the decision review options? Do they understand which is most appropriate for their situation? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
