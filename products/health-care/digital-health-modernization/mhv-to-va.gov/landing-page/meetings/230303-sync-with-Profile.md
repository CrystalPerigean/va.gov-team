Mural board -> went through Profile and anywhere else saw preferences…
	- Liz: MHV equivalent of VA Profile - "Personal Information". All found on Mural. At end of research - found out there's another setting in MHV w/ preferences - didn't dig into that. Somewhere there's preferences re: secure messaging. 

What are considered "preferences"
	- Would have considered secure mess "preferences"
	- Recommendations doc in folder

Recommendations doc: 
	- Convos around what needed to be displayed in MHV vs. Profile - how well received? 
	- None has been implemented. No changes to Profile
	- Retiring things from MHV - however, coming from perspective of VA Profile. When shared w/ Carnetta - wanted HA team to consider. 
	- Never got sense that Carnetta onboard w/ retiring self-journaling features, but Profile's not appropriate place for those.
	- Health ID card - doesn't connect to anything, Veterans confused - think card connected to database. It's not - just a card you print out w/ some info. Most people use another card. 
	- MyLinks - unclear how valuable this feature is. 
	- Concept of self-entry: all considered same thing
		○ Self-entry journal - doesn't connect to anything else. Only can reference in MHV. 
	- Donor information - can put in blood type, prints on card. 
	- Card is half-built feature. Can't edit all data fields on card. Never got finished. 
	
	- What do yellow lines mean?  
		○ Proposed to get rid of, but don't have stakeholder buy-in
		○ Red lines - definitely getting rid of
		○ Nothing has been implemented

Health-specific space: 
	- Did card sort - had some findings on where Veterans might want different preferences located

In current notifications settings page: 
	- Some VAMC-specific (e.g., prescription tracker, appointment reminders)
		○ Not sure if the same in MHV preference (specifically prescription tracker)
