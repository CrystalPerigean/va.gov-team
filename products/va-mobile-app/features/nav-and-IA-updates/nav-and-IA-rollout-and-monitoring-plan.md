## Nav & IA - Rollout & Monitoring Plan 


### Q1 2023


### Background

[Nav Product Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/nav-and-IA-updates/nav-and-IA-product-brief.md)

[Mobile App Release Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/releases)


### Whatâ€™s the plan?

The Navigation and IA changes will be released as the **v2.0** of the app.  This decision was made due to the large scope of changes and because this marks a new level of maturity for the app.

  <tr>
   <td><strong>Timeline</strong>

   <td><strong>Users</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Goal</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Day 1 - 3/28
   </td>
   <td>100%

   <td rowspan="2" >Release Feature

  </tr>
  <tr>

  </tr>
</table>


Because the Nav and IA changes are so fundamental to how the app is built, putting the changes behind a Feature Flag is not realistic.  We will not be rolling the feature out slowly, but instead all users will get the changes with the app release. 


### What are we monitoring?
