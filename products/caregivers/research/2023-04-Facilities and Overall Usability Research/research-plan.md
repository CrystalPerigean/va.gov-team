# Research Plan for [1010 Team, Caregiver Application (10-10CG) Facilities and Overall Usability Study, April 2023]

## Background
This research is to be conducted on the application for Family Caregiver Benefits (10-10CG) by the 1010 team. This is an existing application and the goal of this study is to get an overall understanding of the usability for key tasks as well as test the updated facilities question and selection feature.

### Facilities Overview
During previous usability studies on this form (research findings: February 2021, April 2021) we have found the VA medical facility selection page caused many users confusion. A few trends include:

- Users are confused why the facility they are familiar with isn't listed. (The current dropdown list only includes facilities with a Caregiver support staff and not all possible facilities.)
- Users are uncertain which facility to specify (Eg. Primary care, therapist, oncologist, most recent, etc.)
- Users that live on state borders potentially would have to select a different state from where they live in order to find their preferred facility (located in another state).

Additional technical and user experience concerns include:
- The team wants to update and use an upcoming release of the facility API to manage the list of all community and VA locations and include search by zip code and city in additon to state.
- By including both community and VA health care facilities in the search list, this could potentialy add confusion to the process around where a Caregiver Support Coordinator is located.
- The question content needs to be in plain language as well as make the process clear as to how this answer will impact the caregiver and/or Veteran during their application process.

### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) this research supports are:

**Goals**
- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online

**Increase**
- Completion rate of online transactions
- Usage of digital, self-service tools

**Decrease**
- Time to successful complete and submit online transactions


### Veteran Journey
This product fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) during the following stages:

- Taking care of myself
- Aging

A moment that matters in the journey is during the aging phase when Veterans increasingly seeking alternatives to institutional based care and instead wish to stay independent for longer, remaining in their homes and communities. 



## Research Goals	
1. Discover if the facility content updates are clear and understandable for participants
2. Determine if the facility search functionality is easy to use and accessible
3. Discover what is easy or difficult to complete on the form and why
4. Obtain an understanding of the usability of the form overall, how tasks from this study compares to past research findings and future design iterations  


### Outcome
This research will test the updates to the VA Facility question content, page flow and search functionality to make sure they are understandable and accessible. Secondly, this research will provide a qualitative understanding of the overall usability of this application by both Veterans and Caregivers. We will use the findings from this study combined with key insights from previous studies to guide and compare future design iterations. 


### Research questions


**Discover if the facility content updates are clear and understandable for participants**
- Is the new version of this question easy to understand and answer with little confusion?
- Does this new version result in clarifying questions or additional information needed to complete?
- Is the new version easy for the participant to understand why they are selecting a facility and how it impacts the caregiver application process?
- Does the confirmation screen after selection add any additional confusion or result in clarifying questions?


**Determine if the facility search functionality is easy to use and accessible**
- Are users able to navigate through the facility selection without difficulty?
- Do participants know what to input in the text search field?
- Can users easily use the search input and understand what choices are populated from that search?
- Is it clear how to reselect a facility if one is selected in error?
- How do screen reader participants respond to the confirmation pages?

**Discover what is easy or difficult to complete on the form and why** 
- What questions on the form cause the participant the most pause or confusion?
- What questions on the form does the participant appear to answer quickly, easily and correctly?
- At what points in the form do participants ask clarifiying questions 

**Obtain an understanding of the usability of the form overall, how tasks from this study compares to past research findings and future design iterations**
- What tasks do participants seem to do consistently well on or that the consistently struggle?
- What are the recurring pain points across participants?



### Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1**

Our hypothesis is that users will understand what they are selecting on the facilities page and how that impacts the caregiver applicaiton process. The participants will find the confirmation page to be helpful and informative and it will not add it more complexity or confusion. 

**Hypothesis 2**

Our hypothesis is that users will be able to navigate through the facility selection relatively easily, but might have issues with the following:
- Understanding the difference between community and VA facilities/Caregiver Support Facilities
- The number of results shown
- A desire to filter results and how to filter
- Not recognizing the name of the facility they are looking for/overlooking address 


**Hypothesis 3**

Our hypothesis is that participants in this study will also echo previous research findings around confusion about who qualifies as a primary or secondary caregiver and why certain information is asked, such as insurance, or how it impacts the application. 




## Method

## Recruitment	


### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research is a mix of Veterans, Caregivers, and family members. 

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study.

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 


### Prepare
We will be testing the existing approved application that is in staging mirroring production. 

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 


### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: **TBD 2023**


### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
* Maximum Sessions per day: 4


### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
