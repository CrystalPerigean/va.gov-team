## Research Goals

Based on the previous tree test findings, the team iterated on the information architecture for the health hub and health apartment. As the team considers how to properly include the Health Apartment on VA.gov to ensure Veterans and Caregivers to get and manage their health care benefits, this research will help inform decisions on the information architecture of the health apartment and how it links to the broader VA.gov structure.

The goal of this research is to gather quantitative insights on the information architecture for the health hub and the health apartment that was modified based on the previous tree testing. We will be looking to better understand how labeling and organization of the menus impact users’ ability to successfully complete tasks.

We will have two sets of key tasks for Veterans and families/caregivers. We will not only test the information architecture of the health care hub and health apartment, but also test the deeper structure of the site navigation, such as the left navigation.

## Research Questions

Can Veterans and their families/caregivers navigate proposed changes to the information architecture of VA.gov in order to find information and complete key tasks as they get and/or manage their VA health care benefits?


## Methodology 

- We conducted 2 unmoderated tree tests utilizing Optimal Workshop’s Tree jack tool
- Participants were asked to complete 12 tasks by navigating a menu structure and indicating wher ethey would be able to find the answer
- Of the 12 tasks, 6 tasks were related to learning about or applying for health care benefits, and 6 tasks were related to managing a person’s health care or health care benefit
- Tasks were randomized to avoid bias from learning the tree as the test progressed
- Participants were allowed to skip tasks to allow if needed, however participants that skipped 100% of the tasks were excluded from results 


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_

All Veterans, regardless of their health care enrollment status, will understand that information related to applying for benefits will be within the “Get benefits” area, and information related to managing their benefits will be within the “My health” section.
- Likely true - Most participants went the appropriate area for the task, but some participants did look in "My health" for tasks related to getting benefits. 

Moving supplemental content out of the “Get benefits” section and grouping information by core benefit offerings will help Veterans and family members more easily find information related to exploring and applying for benefits. 
- Likely true - Modifications to streamline the benefit hub proved mostly successful, with the exception of community care content, which proved to be difficult to find.  

With a clearer hub name, family members and caregivers will prefer to find information related to exploring and applying for health care for themselves, as well as tasks related to managing their own health benefits, within the “Family and caregiver” benefit hub.
- Likely false - Family members and caregivers still primarily utilized the main health care benefit hub to complete tasks, with a small percentage of participants utilizing the family member hub.

Participants will look in “Health history” to answer general questions about their health instead of looking to download their entire health record. 
- Likely false - Participants still primarily went to the medical record download option for questions relating to their health data



## Key Findings

1. Veterans were equally successful in completing tasks regardless of VA health care enrollment status
2. The revised health care benefit hub IA performed the same or better than previous versions in most tasks
3. The family member hub plays an important role in the findability of information and tasks that family members and caregivers need
4. Veterans struggled to find general benefits information once within the “My health” section
5. Participants initially looked for test results within “Medical records” but selected answers equally as much in “Health history” 
6. Copay rates and community care content must be prominently cross-linked from key places within the “Get health care benefits” and “My health” sections
7. Visitors are still not clear on where to find information on travel pay


## Details of Findings 



**Finding 1: Veterans completed tasks successfully regardless of their VA health care enrollment status**
- Both Veterans enrolled in VA health care and Veterans not enrolled in VA health care had similar task success rates (within 20%*) in 9/12 tasks, and 6/12 tasks had success rates > 70%
- Veterans not enrolled in VA health care had significantly lower task success in tasks for mental health, community care, and labs and tests
  - For the mental health task, Veterans not enrolled in VA health care were divided in where they navigated first – Get health care benefits, My health, More resources and support - resulting in varied navigational paths and answers, whereas almost all Veterans enrolled in health care went directly to “Get health care benefits” and selected the correct answer
  - For the Community care task, 31% of Veterans not enrolled in VA health care incorrectly selected “Types of care” within the “Get health care benefits” spoke – this audience may be less familiar with the concept of community care
  - For the labs and tests tasks, 20% of Veterans not enrolled in VA health care selected options within “Messages” and “Appointments”

It was assumed that Veterans not enrolled in health care would have slightly lower task success rates (within 20%) due to experience and knowledge of the benefit and information

**Hypothesis**: All Veterans, regardless of their health care enrollment status, will understand that information related to applying for benefits will be within the “Get benefits” area, and information related to managing their benefits will be within the “My health” section.



**Finding 2: The revised health care hub IA performed the same or better than previous versions in most tasks for both Veterans and family members/caregivers**

- Veterans in H1 had similar or higher success rates in 4/6 tasks when compared to baseline
- Family/caregivers in H1 had similar or higher success rates in 5/6 tasks when compared to baseline
- The community care and copay rates tasks will continue to be tested and refined for placement, labeling, and crosslinking opportunities
- The percent of family/caregiver participants that incorrectly selected Veteran content to determine family member eligibility decreased in H2 (19%) compared to baseline (27%)

**Hypothesis**: Moving supplemental content out of the “Get benefits” section and grouping information by core benefit offerings will help Veterans and family members more easily find information related to exploring and applying for benefits. 


**Finding 3: The family member hub plays an important role in the findability of information and tasks that family members and caregivers need**

- Family/caregiver participants predominantly navigated to and selected an answer in the “Family and caregiver” hub for information on health care eligibility for themselves – this has been a consistent pattern across all tests
- There was a significant increase in the number of participants that first navigated to and selected answers in the “Family and caregiver” hub for the travel pay task
- In H2, the word “benefits” was dropped from the hub name, and the word “caregiver” was added – these label changes may have contributed to more participants looking to the health care hub for benefit information (dental care and mental health), and to the family and caregiver hub for caregiver benefits (travel pay)

**Hypothesis**: With a clearer hub name, family members and caregivers will prefer to find information related to exploring and applying for health care for themselves, as well as tasks related to managing their own health benefits, within the “Family and caregiver” benefit hub. 



**Finding 4: Veterans struggled to find general benefits information once within the “My health” section of H2**

- Some Veterans and caregivers navigated to “My health” at some point to find benefits information related to dental care, mental health care, community care, and copay rates – information that is relevant to those already enrolled in VA health care
- However, few participants navigated into the “My health benefits” section that contained the information, and even fewer selected an option once there indicating the placement and labeling may not be entirely clear
- These tasks will continue to be evaluated in ongoing research for the health portal to ensure Veterans can easily find and get to supporting  benefits information within the portal

**Finding 5: Participants initially looked for test results within “Medical records” but selected answers equally as much in “Health history”**

- Participants in both groups predominantly navigated to “My health > Medical records” initially to find information on a recent lab test, and only 4% of Veterans and 19% of family/caregivers initially went to “Health history” 
- Of the Veteran participants that navigated to “My health > Medical records”, a significant number backed out to look in different areas -  42% of Veterans and 27% of family/caregiver participants
- Ultimately, participants selected answers equally in “Medical records” and “Health history”

**Hypothesis**: Participants will look in “Health history” to answer general questions about their health instead of looking to download their entire health record. 



**Finding 6: Visitors are still not clear on where to find information on travel pay**

- While the travel pay tasks success rates improved over the previous H1 test, they are still significantly lower than the baseline scores
- In both tests, once a participant navigated into My health, they all proceeded to select the correct answer – however, there was not an overwhelming percentage of participants that immediately went to “My health” for this task indicating participants do not have confidence in where to go first
- A significant number of family/caregivers participants went directly to the “Family and caregiver” hub to complete this task
- There was a significant reduction in the percentage of Veterans that looked in the “Current service members” hub in this test (4%) compared to the “Service member benefits” hub in baseline (26%) and H1 (24%)

**Finding 7: Copay rates and community care content must be prominently cross-linked from key places in both the “Get health care benefits” and “My health” sections**

- In both tasks, audiences primarily looked in the “Get health care benefits” area first, however there was also a significant number of participants that looked within “My health” in their first clicks. 
- For community care, participants who did navigate to “More resources and support” (the correct section),  often selected incorrect answers there – 13% in the Veteran test, and 24% in the family/caregiver test
- For copay rates, those that looked within “My health” rarely found the correct answer there – only 6% of Veterans, and 8% of family/caregivers

## Additional Insights




## Recommendations

1. Consider building out and testing a more robust experience within the family and caregiver benefit hub that includes both information on benefits as well as tasks that family members may need to complete related to their own benefits or benefits they receive for caring for their veteran (i.e. travel pay, apply for transferred benefits, add a dependent, etc)
2. Consider testing a combined section that includes the content in “Health history” and “Medical records” given they ultimately provide the same information
3. Add a section on where to get care, including in the community, to the main Veteran health care page in addition to testing alternative labels to “community care” that all audiences would be familiar with
4. Continue to evaluate the labeling, organization, and design opportunities, to improve the findability of core health care benefit information such as community care, mental health care, dental care, and copay rates within “My health”
5. Crosslink travel pay in key areas such as “More resources”, “Family and caregiver hub”, and content pages with “Get benefits”
6. Move to qualitative testing of the IA within a designed experience
