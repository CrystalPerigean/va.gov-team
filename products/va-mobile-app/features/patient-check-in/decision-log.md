## Q & A

|Question| Answer|
|------| --------------------|
| CIE team assumes that the scope of this work is limited to the following: (1) Mobile app sends our API the patient and appointment identifiers for a single patient & appointment (2) API checks-in the identified patient for the identified appointment (3) API sends back success/error information <br><br>CIE team assumes that Pre-Check-in tasks (i.e. contact information verification) is not part of the scope<br><br>Are these assumptions correct? | Owner: Rachel|
| Similar to the above - very early scope conversations had potentially included geolocation or push notifications, to proactively alert veterans that they could do check-in on the mobile app. <br><br> It sounds like the actual MVP scope will be limited to displaying a way to enter the check-in workflow, from (somewhere still TBD) in the mobile app, WITHOUT push notifications, geolocation, or any other proactive method of letting veterans know check-in is possible. Is that assumption correct? | Owner: Rachel|
| Seems to be a direct contradiction in the Check-in MVP requirements document between these two sections: <br><br> - <b>Discovery questions and answers #7:</b> How will feature like travel reimbursement be integrated in the check-in experience and are there important milestones there? a. There has been a ton of work done on how travel reimbursement will be integrated into the day-of check in workflow. I don’t think this is relevant for MVP, however. The check-in team can provide more details + research + wireframes + architecture if desired. <br> - <b>Acceptance criteria #7:</b> Views a confirmation message with directions on what to do next a. Info on how to request travel pay <br><br> Which of these two is correct? Is incorporating travel pay information into check-in part of MVP, or not?  | The CIE team is currently incorporating a feature to allow a Veteran to submit a travel claim as part of eCheck-in, however, it is currently in a research phase and not available in production, nor will it be for a few months; the mobile app team is welcome to use the BTSSS API to submit a travel claim directly (currently only mileage-only claims are available via the API)|
|Acceptance criteria 5 in the Check-in MVP scope document includes requirements to inform the veteran of why check-in is not possible on the app, with a specific example of being outside of the time window where check-in is allowed for an appointment. <br><br> Does the scope of this requirement include informing the veteran when mobile check-in is not enabled by a location? (Discovery questions & answers 3b: roughly half of clinics DO NOT have mobile check-in enabled) <br> Similarly, does the scope of this requirement cover any other known circumstances where check-in would not be available on mobile for a veteran? | Owner: Rachel/Patrick|
|The path for check-in on the standalone web app (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/engineering/qa/test-cases-check-in.md#test-case-a-happy-path---successful-check-in) is predicated on a workflow of "answer check-in related questions (if not answered within past 7 days)" THEN "view list of appointments" THEN "click check-in for specific appointment". <br><br> The entry point for check-in on the mobile app has not been determined, but initial conversations within the mobile app team had it located somewhere within the appointments list or appointment details for a veteran, rather than a standalone activity that pulls appointments information. We've definitely run into problems in the past where the API(s) available for a new feature required using the exact same sequence as the current team, and did not support re-ordering of the workflow to better fit within the mobile app IA (ex: "view list of appointments" THEN "click check-in for a specific appointment" THEN "answer check-in related questions (if not answered within past 7 days)" <br><br> Have we been able to confirm whether reordering the sequence of steps in the workflow is possible with the check-in API(s)? | The CIE team determines if the Veteran has, within 7 days of the appointment, verified their contact information; if the info needs to verified the Veteran is asked to verify if the contact information is still correct; if the contact info is not correct, the Veteran is asked to check-in with a staff member; I don't know if that process will be part of your MVP or not |  Owner: Rachel/Patrick|
| AC #5 As is, how might native mobile app add challenges to a veteran’s experience?  Current call out  No internet = frustration for web and mobile apps. Best alternative option is a human.  Potential challenges around poster display/confusion.  Will the current posters be updated to advise Veteran's of additional option to check in with App?  Will the banner and QR code scanner essentially go away?  1) If banner is displayed what would make a Veteran go to the app vs. continuing through QR code. 2) If there isn't info avail advising Veteran to go to the app to do check in how will they know? 3) What is the planned communication for communicating this and when to use poster vs. app. 4) According to feature guide, the web offers check in with multiple languages, Spanish, Tagalog, & English.  Currently, the only language avail on the app is English.  Will there be expectations that the app offer these additional languages for MVP to be inclusive to others? |  Owner: Rachel/Patrick|
| Since there are going to be multiple entry points (the QR code & web app, and VA:Health & Benefits app) — is there any defensive coding we need to do, or the API team needs to do, to make sure they don’t accidentally do check-in twice (once from each application)? Ex: is there any caching of any of this information in staging? Where does the web app team currently check if the appt is already checked-in, and do they need to add more checks at a different point assuming that the veteran could check in on mobile at ANY POINT in the web app’s flow? | The web app team checks if an appointment is already checked in when a Veteran texts "check in", and does not return a link if there are not any appointments eligible for check-in. An appointment cannot be checked in twice - if the API call is made to check-in more than once, subsequent calls will return an error. Both apps need to ensure that they are handling the case of an already checked-in appointment and display an appropriate message to the Veteran. |
|AC 3 "roughly half of all clinics have mobile check-in enabled", for the half that is not enabled how does that experience differ from the Patient Check In MVP (pre-registration, pre-visit, pre-check-in, check-in? How does the min valuable / min release of pre-registration in mobile work on clinics not enabled?   | Owner: Rachel|
|Patient Check-In MVP Document references pre-registration, pre-visit, pre-check-in, check-in but the Sketch document only has pre-visit and check-in headings in Design and User Flow. Can pre-registration and pre-checkin also be labeled in the document? | Owner: Kristen/Ben |
| In the existing Check-In Veteran journey, are there known and current gaps / issues / concerns / veteran complaints that only the Check-In Product Team would be aware of that would be meaningful and impactful for Mobile to be aware of? | Owner: Stephen|
| What is the web team's expected timeline for the LoROTA workflow? | Owner: Stephen|
| What are good baseline numbers for pre-check to check-in dropoffs? Any reasoning for the drop offs  | These are two sperate and somewhat unrelated things that we don't think of in a linear way. We don’t fully expect for pre-check-ins to become day of check-ins. Here are some of the reasons for this: <ul><li>Phone appointments are pre-check-in only and day-of check isn't available for them</li><li>Pre-check-in happens days in advance when the patient has reliable internet which they may not have on the day-of.</li><li>Many people perfer to check-in with a person when they arrive at a clinic.</li><li>We control the experience with pre-check-in by sending out the text un-prompted. The day-of experience is dependant on the poster placement and how prominently information relating to check-in is displayed.</li></ul> |
| Will the web team be rolling out unified check-in at the same time as mobile does? If so, what release strategy will Web use? | Web unified check-in will release as a pilot, either to a percentage of Veterans or to a specific VISN or facility. Performance during the pilot will inform whether or not to increase the rollout and mobile app readiness. During the pilot performance period, the mobile app team should begin evaluating the unified check-in experience for inclusion in the mobile app from a UX and architectural engineering perspective. For example, how will the mobile app adapt check-in to support unified check-in knowing that it may have some differences compared to web check-in, including lack of pre-check-in support, how and where check-in is initiated in the user flow, and visual design. Decision and timing of inclusion into the mobile app should include product owners, OCTO members and IVC. <br><br>What does need more discussion is if or when mobile app will switch to initiating check-in from a VEText initiated reminder, which is set to release alongside the web unified check-in expereience.       |
