# Things to know about the 10-10EZ
This document contains tidbits, odds & ends, and information about the 10-10EZ form, development, testing and anything else that isn't captured in other documents.

### Development
- 7/29/22 - The Place of Birth state dropdown must only include 50 states, DC and Other. ES will not accept any other values at this time.
