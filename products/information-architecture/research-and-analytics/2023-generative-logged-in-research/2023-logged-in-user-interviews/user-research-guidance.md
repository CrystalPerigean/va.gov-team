# User research guidance

**Last updated: March 1, 2023**

Given that I (Samara) will likely be out as this research is planned and happens, this is some guidance on how to create a research plan that gets at what we are hoping to capture in this research.

**That being said, Mikki and Chante should also co-sign on this to make sure that we are in alignment**.

## Research goals

### Primary

Identify problems and expectations with navigating the logged-in experience on VA.gov.

- Can people find tasks they need to complete? Can they do this without the homepage/My VA links?
- How can we make the site easier to navigate for logged-in users?

### Things to watch out for, if applicable

If possible, it would be helpful to note/capture the following. You do not need to go out of your way to create tasks around these, but we'd definitely want notes on the following if/when they come up:

- What prompts people to sign-in to the site (eg. do they do it right away? do they wait until they get to a content page with a sign in prompt? do they use the sign in button in the main nav, or on the homepage?)
- Does the homepage need to exist when users are logged-in? Can My VA replace it?
- Is there confusion among the homepage vs. My VA vs. the new health hub landing page? 
  - Note: there is going to be work done on the health apartment team specifically targeting this question, but if you happen to observe anything that could give us insight or be useful to that team, it's worth noting.
- Does the layout of content pages that lead to tools affect the user experience of navigating to tools? 

## Methods

- Please test using the actual website. We should not need a prototype for this.
- Please test using whatever version of the website shows both the new homepage AND the new health landing page (tbh, I don't know if these will actually be available at the same URL). I believe the new health landing page is supposed to go live mid-March.
- We've talked about *not* starting people on the website, but they'll obviously need to get there eventually so we can evaluate the navigation. So, where you start people is up to you, but we'll need to make sure to eventually guide them to VA.gov if we opt to start them on a blank browser.
- Once people are on the website, I'm sure they will rely on the homepage or My VA to get around, and that's fine if someone says they'd click a link relevant to a particular task. However, we're not here to test links on the homepage or My VA, and we already know people overly rely on these to get around. So, I think if there is a task where someone says they'd just click a link on the homepage or My VA, we should also ask them to demonstrate how they'd do the same thing if they were not allowed to use My VA or the homepage (ie. how would they use the nav/search?).

### Tasks

- We've talked about asking people to show us where they would go to complete ~5 tasks. We haven't talked about what those tasks are, and I think we can maybe have some flexibility depending on a person's individual benefits/circumstances. People don't actually need to complete these tasks; the issue is more can they find them easily (and if they can only find them using homepage/My VA links, could they find these tasks without those pages?).
- For these tasks, I'd like us to ask people to do some things that don't have clear links on the homepage or My VA.

### User types

- We haven't decided if this research is veteran-only, or if we should open to other user types. I think this could go either way, but I would say that veterans should be the main focus.
- Re: how many people to talk to -- this might depend on different user types. I don't think you need to talk to 10 veterans, but 10 people might be an appropriate number of people to talk to if that's a combo of veterans, dependents, caregivers, etc.
- We should include assistive tech users, but we can include a combo of people who both do and do not use assistive tech.

## OCTO & contractor partners

- Assuming I am out while this happens, Mikki Northuis and Chante Lantos-Swett are leading this work from the OCTO perspective.
- The health apartment team (ie. Lauren Alexanderson & co) have interest in this work too, though this should not turn into something solely focused on health tasks or the new health experience. 
- For OCTO: Please review the the research plan with Mikki, Chante, Lauren Alexanderson (if she has bandwidth), and Coulton Bunney for feedback/input.
- For contractors: Please consult with Robyn Singleton (health apartment; doing research on how to reconcile the homepage/My VA/health landing pages) and Cindy Merrill (research for the sitewide team) to make sure this work compliments research they are doing. Mikki is involved in all efforts, so she can help connect dots as well.
