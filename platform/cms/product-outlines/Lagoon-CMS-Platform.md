## Lagoon CMS Platform 

Last updated February 2023

This README page serves as a "front door" to documentation and resources pertaining to the MVP for Lagoon. Lagoon has been indentified as an option for BRD of the Drupal CMS. 

## Product Context/Decisions
With Jenkins end of life approaching around the summer of 2023, it is imperative that the CMS Platform finds a system that allows developers to locally develop their code and their services with Docker and run the exact same system in production. We have decided to explore Lagoon as a Jenkins replacement that not only replaces currently BRD (build, release, deploy) capabilities, but enhances it. 


## Hypothesis
- Lagoon will provide a streamlined BRD process with enhanced abilities for a seamless Drupal platform.
- Lagoon will enhance Drupal scalability.
