Live Bot Usability Testing Observer Notes

07/18/22

VA.gov familiarity
Uses site for access to benefits, ebenefits
Once a month
“Everything is accurate and easily accessible”
Comes from a family of veterans 

Takeaways
Yes she anticipated a feedback survey
Sign in providers: Most familiar w DS logon as the most broad login option. MyHealthyVet is for health info. Not aware of login.gov or id.me
Some discomfort with bot storing password, but satisfied if it is required by the system
New feature characterization: Clinical features are highest priority 
Checks for updates more frequently when expecting things like test results. (Are there no notifications?)


Surprises
After asking a question, participant said “Thank you kindly”, bot doesnt expect an interruption in the EOC flow -> bot said “Did you want to switch back to end of conversation topic?”
Expected a prompt to sign out after feedback survey
Biggest pain point with disability rating area is getting a general idea of timeline - validates previous research studies that show veterans find claims/appeals timelines very unpredictable and want more milestones and dates
Based on feedback and suggestions, it felt like she never saw the crisis link at top of page. (Could it be called out better?)
Expects a live agent for “chatbox”, but later said if she realized it was a bot, she wouldn’t use it. And at end of conversation, she said it was great that VA was progressing on tech, and she looks forward to what comes next.


07/20/22 morning session
Takeaways
User uses the site frequently (once a week)
User doesn’t feel familiar (or maybe comfortable) with site even if he uses it all the time
User has a clear understanding  of what he can get from the site and knows how to use the bot  (even if he was a bit hesitant to jump right into it)

Surprises
User doesn’t try things right away: it might be because of the audience but he was trying to guess what the bot would do before trying it out, almost like he didn’t want to offend the bot



07/20/22 afternoon session
Takeaways
Has hearing disability
Unfamiliar with video conferencing 
Very familiar with Va.gov (daily routine for him)
HealtheVet for appts/prescriptions
General inquiries
Tries to self service info digging for getting through roadblocks 
You think you’re going to the site to get an answer but the answer doesn’t exist there. Too general. Amazing how much info is not available on Va.gov
Went to Contact Us > Helpful VA phone numbers earlier today and provided general information rather than specific (like his local VA for daily use).
Copy and pasted Dental Care prompt
Didn’t like he had to navigate to Dental Care VA.gov page for more info. Wanted the chatbot to have a conversation with him to prompt him for more questions. Doesn’t like when chatbots drop and having to start all over again. Wants the chatbot to help answer his question rather than having to navigate to other page. 	
Doesn’t have time to sit around. If asks a question expects to get to bottom of it or closest to. Didn’t ask for pamphlets/research. Wants answer 
Reached a Help Desk Agent who directed him to a particular website to reset password who gave different instructions than what a web page was saying.
Password reset
I want to reset my password > Send an email OR Provide information they have OR direct them to help line
Feels Va.gov website is pretty secure. Never been compromised
Additional topics: Wants shortcuts - ease of discovery of his benefits. Always bothered by how many steps he has to take if he hasn’t already explored that offering and knows direct path/shortcuts
Community aggravation topic
He is a former marine and a lot of marines don’t feel as comfortable with computers. Not all get degrees and a lot go into skilled labor. Have to have a way that they don’t feel barrier to entry
Write from 8th grade to masters. Make it easier enough to understand without being embarrassing/condescending

Surprises
Expects more conversational. Wants the chatbot to ask individual questions to clarify, NOT go to another website
Can narrow down to last possible step then punt to another page to find out more
Has a login.gov account but doesn’t trust it
Most passwords he retains in his computer. Most of the time login.gov will tell him his password isn’t correct. Then puts in same password again and doesn’t work
Could be ** (Ex: United.com)
Account option requirements
Have to be federal employee, etc so thinks should lead people to which one to choose and why (and what parameters they must meet)

07/25/22 
Familiarity
Uses MyHealthyVet for prescriptions, appts, records
Visits Va.gov at least twice a month

Takeaways
Felt that showing feedback survey following the completion of a ‘task’ is appropriate 
Would like to use back button to navigate back to chatbot from login provider screens
Ability to secure message health providers is very important. Clinical features are highest priority for them.
Would like more transparency into claims timeline
User assumed chatbot was a live agent in the beginning. Common theme.
2nd user I’ve observed that returns to site to check their test results. Is there no notification mechanism (email / text / …)


Surprises
Wanted to click on the questions presented as part of the 
intro/greeting in the chatbot
Pain point: Password reset involves OTP process/too many redirects to different screens

07/28/22

VA.gov familiarity
Familiar with VA.gov. Get medical records. Use VA apps. Source of all VA information
MyHealtheVet once or twice a week
Problems with screen readers and magnification -- accessibility.
Has login creds. 
Uses Chrome and Explorer.
Tablet
Never used chatbot

Takeaways
Directs him to VA dental care page
Expects a question that ask “Did that answer your question?”
At the end of the actual chat portion
Questions with Multiple choice
Has a utility that creates a computer generated password. Sometimes hard to erase that one or use his own.
“Reset password” utterance and expect next screen with instructions
Familiar with DS Logon (dental, doesn’t use much) / ID.me (verify that you’re actual veteran) / MyHealtheVet (medical)
Would expect a message saying you successfully reset your password
Create account - would expect a new screen to pop up
Helpful in providing feedback
Zoomtext


Surprises
Screenreader affects the use of this utility and it acts weirdly
Asked a question “would one account get you access to the others”
