Last modified: April 20, 2023


## Moderator Logistics 

### 2-3 Days Before the Session 

- Review VA Platform’s [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions).
- Perigean will send you the sign in instructions for using Zoom accounts for user research. The first time you use their account you will need to coordinate with Perigean on 2FA. 

### Starting the Session 

- Sign out of personal Zoom. 
- Create thread in #feedback-backchannel. 
- Add observer instructions into the thread. 
- Connect earbuds. 
- Open up CodePen prototype in web browser. 
- Check that a11yInfoContainer is commented out in CodePen. 
- Open up the [Zoom guide](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/how-to-use-zoom-for-user-research) in a web browser. 
- Mute your Slack notifications. 
- After signing in to Zoom, you will be logged in as a presenter. Be sure to enter your name. 
- Check to see if recording is set to save in the cloud. 
- In the Participant “More” menu, make sure “Play Join and Leave Sound” is unchecked.
- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except for the participant is on mute.  
- In the Share menu, make sure all participants can share their screen. 
- Keep observers in the waiting room to ask the participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell the observers to have their full name displayed and be ready to turn their cameras on for a brief introduction to the participant when they are admitted to the session.

## Intro - 5 minutes 

Hello and thank you for joining today. My name is Ben. How are you doing today? 

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be helping by taking notes. 

Today, I'm going to ask you to do some specific tasks using a prototype that I will share with you in just a few moments. 

But, before we start, I want to go over a few things: 

*Check to see if anyone is waiting to join the room. If not, skip the first bullet below.*  

- First, I have some other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Previously, Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I wanted to ask again now to be sure before we get going. So, are you okay with letting observers in for this session? 
     - If “no,” ask the observers to leave Zoom via Slack. 
     - If “yes,” let other observers into the room. 
          - And, here are some of my colleagues. Team, please unmute your camera and microphone and briefly introduce yourself with your first name and role with VA.
          - And now for my colleagues who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth and mute your audio, that would be great. Thank you.  
- So, this session should take about an hour, maybe a little less. I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task. 
- And, in this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers. We are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We’re testing a website to learn how we can make it easier to use for Veterans. I welcome any and all of your feedback and I won’t be offended by opinions you express. 
- If for any reason, and at any time, you want to stop this session, please just let me know. 
- And, lastly, are you comfortable if I record this session today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, but the recordings are deleted after we complete our analysis. Also, none of your comments will ever be attributed to you directly. So, is it okay to record this session? 

*If “no,” skip to Warm-Up Questions.* 

Great. Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Okay, I’m going to start the recording now.   

*Start recording. Select “record to cloud” so that the recordings are saved to Perigean’s account.* 

Okay, I have started recording. Once again, are you comfortable if I record this session today? 

## Warm-Up Questions - 1 Minute

So, before we go to the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions. 

- Are you joining this session today from your smartphone or computer? 
- And, what brand or operating system is it? (For example, is it an iPhone or Android?)
- Have you been to a VA health care facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 12 months? 
- Have you ever used your smartphone to check in for a medical appointment? If so, approximately, when was the last time you’ve done that? 
- Have you ever filed or received payment for a travel reimbursement claim for a VA medical appointment?  

Great. Thank you. 

## Screen Sharing Instructions - 2 Minutes

Now, I’d like to be able to see your screen so I can see how you’re using the prototypes. Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me today? 

Great. Now, if there’s any apps, webpages or notifications on your device that you’d like to close or turn off before I’m able to see your screen, I’ll give you a moment to do that now. 

So, now I’ll talk you through how to share your screen.  

Please tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap the screen you will see a menu appear at the bottom of your screen. In that menu, tap (or select) "Share." If you don’t see “Share” in that menu, you may need to tap the menu and drag it to the left to uncover more options. And, when you see the “Share” option, go ahead and select it.   

Then, tap (or select) "Screen." Then, tap the words, “Start Broadcast." Now, tap (or select) anywhere on the paragraph at the top of the screen that starts with "Everything on your screen." Perfect. 

### Can’t Share Screen Strategy

Well, I am sorry we are having trouble with the screen share today. But, we would like to try to continue this session anyways. Would you be open to verbally walking me through what you’re doing on your screen?  

## Veteran Tasks 

### Pre-Check-In Text Message Tasks - 5 Minutes

So, now we’ll review the prototype. The prototype is for the process of confirming your upcoming medical appointment on your smartphone, which typically happens a few days before your appointment, and checking in to an appointment using your smartphone once you arrive at the clinic. So, two different tasks that you would typically complete on different days. 

You might be familiar with this process already, but what we’ll review in the prototype today are some new variations that we’re looking to collect feedback on from Veterans. 

So, in the prototype, some things you’ll be able to click, while other things you won’t. Nothing in it is your information. It’s all just pretend. And, you’re not actually filing for anything with the VA. 

As a reminder, I’m going to be asking you to do some specific tasks using the prototype. However, I’m going to be starting and stopping you to provide specific instructions and ask you questions along the way. Does that sound okay?  

Great. So, typically the process of confirming your upcoming medical appointment begins with a text message that’s sent to your smartphone from the VA. So, what I’d like to do is use the Zoom (messages) chat to pretend the VA is sending you that text message to begin the process. Does that sound okay? 

Great. Now go ahead and tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap the screen you will see that menu appear at the bottom of your screen. In that menu, tap (or select) “Chat.” 

Perfect. I’m going to send you the first message now. When you receive it, go ahead and review the message, pretending it’s a text message to your smartphone, and go ahead and confirm the medical appointment. 

*Your VA appointment is on FEB 2 at 08:00.* 

*Reply:* 
*Y1 to CONFIRM*
*N1 to CANCEL* 
*D1 for DETAILS* 

*For more info call 909-825-7084 options 2 or reply HELP.* 

*Got a fever, cold cough or flu-like symptoms? Stay home and phone VA first: (909) 825-7084 ext. 5085.* 

*Don't catch the bug. Ask your provider to receive your flu shot! Get yours at the VA or anytime at Walgreens Pharmacy.* 

*Find a location of the closest pharmacy here: https://go.usa.gov/xGQk2*

*Send STOP to end messages.* 

Great. Now, I’m going to send you an automated response back. When you receive it, go ahead and review the message, but don’t proceed to the next step yet. 

*To help us prepare for your visit, let's review your information and finish confirming your appointment: https://codepen.io/cie-team/full/rNZELWo*

Could you tell me if the information in these text messages is what you expected to see when starting the process of confirming an upcoming medical appointment? 

Did you find any information in these text messages confusing? 

Is there anything you would recommend changing or adding in these text messages?

Great. Now, please go ahead and continue with confirming your upcoming medical appointment. 

### Pre-Check-In Webpage Tasks - 15 Minutes

Great. Now, this is the first webpage of the process for confirming your upcoming medical appointment on your smartphone, which requires Veterans to confirm their identity using their last name and date of birth. Again, as a reminder, some things in this prototype you can click, some things you can’t, and nothing in here is your actual information. So, for this session today, we don’t need you to provide your actual last name and date of birth. So, please go ahead and find the “continue” button to advance to the next page.   

Great. Now, on this page, review the information on the screen, and as you’re reviewing, I would like you to talk aloud as much as possible so that you share what you’re thinking about and what, if anything, you’re unsure about before advancing to the next page. And remember, nothing in here is your information; it’s just pretend. Lastly, if you select something on the page and need to go back, use the “back” button in your web browser, not the “back to last screen” link that you’ll see on some pages. So, please start reviewing the information on the screen, but remember, don’t advance to the next page yet. 

Great. Now, I’d like for you to go ahead and confirm your upcoming in person appointment that’s scheduled for Monday, February 2nd at 8:00 a.m. with Johnathan Schmidt. 

Great. You can stop here for a moment. So, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is difficult and 5 is easy, how would you rate the ease of finding how to confirm your appointment on the last screen?  

And, why did you choose this rating? 

Now, for these next three pages, read through the information on the screen and then select “Yes” at the bottom of each page to advance to the next. If you’re unsure about anything, please talk aloud so that you share with me what you're thinking about. And remember, nothing in here is your actual information; it’s just pretend. So, it’s perfectly okay if the information in inaccurate.  

Perfect. So, again, on this page, please go ahead and review the information on the screen, and remember to talk aloud as much as possible so that you share what you’re thinking about and what, if anything, you’re unsure about before advancing to the next page. Please go ahead and start reviewing, but remember, don’t advance to the next page yet. 

Great. So, this is the final step of the process for confirming your upcoming medical appointment. Could you tell me if this is the information that you expected to find on the final step?  

Is there anything unclear to you on this page? 

Is there anything missing? 

Is there anything you would recommend changing or adding?

Great. Now, can you recall finding any information about checking in on the actual day of your appointment? And, if so, what were those instructions?

And, how clearly is that information explained? 

Great. And, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is difficult and 5 is easy, how would you rate the ease of understanding that you’ll receive a text message on the day of your appointment when it’s time to check in?  

And, why did you choose this rating? 

So, now, if you think about all of the steps we just went through for confirming your upcoming medical appointment, starting with the text messages and ending with this final page, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is difficult and 5 is easy, how would you rate the ease of completing this process? 

And, why did you choose this rating? 

Was there anything or any step that was unclear to you? 

Overall, was there anything you would recommend changing or adding?

And, now that this upcoming appointment has been confirmed, where might you go to find out if you have any other upcoming appointments that also need to be confirmed? 

Great. And, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is difficult and 5 is easy, how would you rate the ease of understanding that some of your other upcoming medical appointments may require your attention?    

And, why did you choose this rating? 

Is there anything you would recommend changing or adding to make this more clear?

Great. Now, let’s go ahead and view your upcoming appointments that may require your attention. 

Now, once more, I’d like you to review the information on this screen, and as you’re reviewing, I’d like for you to let me know if there’s anything different on this page compared to the first time we visited it. So please, go ahead and start reviewing and let me know what you’re noticing.

So, I’d like to ask, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is it did not meet your expectation and 5 is it does meet your expectation, is this what you expected to find when navigating here from the previous page? (1 is it did not meet your expectation and 5 is it does meet your expectation.)

And, why did you choose this rating? 

Is there anything you would recommend changing or adding?

Great. And also, knowing that you finished the process for confirming your upcoming medical appointment that’s scheduled for Monday, February 2nd at 8:00 a.m., does the information on this page meet your expectations? 

Is there anything else that you might have expected to see? 

Great. Now, once again, I’d like for you to go ahead and confirm the upcoming phone appointment that’s scheduled for Monday, February 9th at 9:30 a.m.

And, you can stop here for a moment. So, once more, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is difficult and 5 is easy, how would you rate the ease of finding how to confirm your appointment from the last screen?  

And, why did you choose this rating? 

And again, this page is the final step of the process for confirming your upcoming medical appointment.  

And, once more, after reviewing the information on this page, is the information on this page what you expected to find?

Is there anything you would recommend changing or adding on this page? 

And again, overall, is there anything you would recommend changing or adding about the steps to confirm an upcoming medical appointment?

Great. Thank you. 

### Check In Tasks - 15 Minutes
 
Now, I’d like for us to change gears a bit and we’ll now review the process for checking in to an appointment from your smartphone on the day of your appointment. So, now, let’s pretend that you’ve just arrived at the clinic for your appointment and you’re walking inside. Then, you get a text message on your smartphone from VA and it reads, “Time to check in for your 1:00 p.m. appointment. Click on the link to check in and let us know that you’ve arrived.” And, what I’d like for you to do is imagine you’ve just received that text message and you’ve tapped on the link to check in and let the staff know that you’ve arrived.  

So, to complete this process, we need to navigate to this prototype. So, I’d like for you to navigate down towards the bottom of this page and select the “Jump to Check-in start” link. This is going to jump us to the check-in prototype. That link is not part of this actual process; it was just a way for me to quickly get you to where you needed to be to view this prototype.  

Perfect. So, similar to the process for confirming your upcoming medical appointment on your smartphone, the process for checking in to an appointment on your smartphone once you arrive requires Veterans to confirm their identity using their last name and date of birth. And, again, as a reminder, some things in this prototype you can click, some things you can’t, nothing in here is your actual information and you’re not actually filing for anything with the VA. So, again, for this session today, we don’t need you to provide your actual last name and date of birth. So, please go ahead and select the “continue” button to advance to the next page.

Great. Now, on this page, review the information on the screen, and as you’re reviewing, I would like you to talk aloud as much as possible so that you share what you’re thinking about and what, if anything, you’re unsure about before advancing to the next page. So, please start reviewing, but remember, don’t advance to the next page yet. And remember, nothing in here is your information; it’s just pretend. 

Great. Now, I’d like for you to go ahead and check in to your 1:00 p.m. appointment, which is on February 2nd. We’re pretending that today is February 2nd. 

Great. And, you can stop here for a moment. So, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is difficult and 5 is easy, how would you rate the ease of finding how to check in for your appointment on the last screen?

And, why did you choose this rating? 

Now, for these next four pages, read through the information on the screen and then select “Yes” at the bottom of each page to advance to the next. If you’re unsure about anything, please talk aloud so that you share with me what you're thinking about. And remember, nothing in here is your actual information and you’re not filing for anything with the VA; it’s just pretend. 

Perfect. So, again, on this page, please go ahead and review the information on the screen, and remember to talk aloud as much as possible so that you share what you’re thinking about and what, if anything, you’re unsure about before advancing to the next page. Please go ahead and start reviewing, but remember, don’t advance to the next page yet. 

Great. So, this is the final step of the process for checking in to a medical appointment. Could you tell me if this is the information that you expected to find on this final step?  

Is there anything unclear to you on this page? 

Would you order anything differently? 

Is there anything missing? 

Is there anything you would recommend changing or adding?

And, now that you’re checked in to your appointment, where might you go to find out if you have other upcoming appointments that might need your attention? 

Great. And, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is difficult and 5 is easy, how would you rate the ease of understanding that some of your other upcoming medical appointments may require attention?    

And, why did you choose this rating? 

Is there anything you would recommend changing or adding to make this more clear?

Great. Now, let’s go ahead and view your upcoming appointments that may require your attention. 

Now, once more, I’d like you to review the information on this screen, but as you’re reviewing, I’d like for you to let me know if there’s anything different on this page compared to when we viewed it just a moment ago. So please, go ahead and start reviewing and let me know what you’re noticing.

So, I’d like to ask, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is it did not meet your expectation and 5 is it does meet your expectation, is this what you expected to find when navigating here from the previous page? (1 is it did not meet your expectation and 5 is it does meet your expectation.)

And, why did you choose this rating? 

Is there anything you would recommend changing or adding?

Great. And also, knowing that you just finished the process for checking in to your appointment that’s scheduled for Monday, February 2nd at 1:00 p.m., does the information on this page meet your expectations? 

Is there anything else that you might have expected to see? 

Great. Now, this time, I’d like for you to go ahead and confirm the upcoming in person appointment that’s scheduled for Monday, February 9th at 1:00 p.m.

And, you can stop here for a moment. So, did you find it easy or difficult to differentiate when you were confirming an upcoming appointment versus checking in to an appointment? 

So, once more, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is difficult and 5 is easy, how would you rate the ease of understanding when you need to confirm an upcoming appointment versus check in? 

And, why did you choose this rating? 

And, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is very unhelpful and 5 is very helpful, how would you rate how helpful it is to be able to confirm other upcoming appointments after you’ve checked in to the appointment that you’re waiting to see the doctor (or provider) for? 

And, why did you choose this rating?   

And again, this page is the final step of the process for checking in to your medical appointment. 

And again, overall, is there anything you would recommend changing or adding about the steps to check in to a medical appointment from your smartphone? 

## Post-Tasks Questions - 2 Minutes

And, overall, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is difficult and 5 is easy, how would you rate the ease of understanding the difference between the two steps of confirming an upcoming appointment and checking in to an appointment? 

And, why did you choose this rating?   

And, overall, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is very unhelpful and 5 is very helpful, how would you rate how helpful it is to be able to review the rest of your upcoming appointments when you’re confirming an upcoming appointment or check in to an appointment?  

And, why did you choose this rating?   

And, the way that checking in to an appointment with your smartphone works today, Veterans arrive at a clinic and find the check-in instructions on a poster somewhere in the clinic, which ask them to text the words “check in” to the phone number 53079 or scan a QR code. That starts the online check in process. So, instead of finding and reviewing a poster at the clinic, would you find it helpful if, instead, the VA sends you a text message when it’s time for you to check in for your appointment?  

And, why do you think that? 

Great. Now, imagine you had a few appointments scheduled in one day. Would you prefer to receive one text message in the morning with instructions on how to check in on your smartphone for each of your appointments or receive separate text messages before each appointment when it’s time to check in for each?  

And, why do you think that? 

## Closing - 1 Minute

Great. Thank you. Well, that is all the questions I have for you today. Is there anything else that we haven’t talked about that you’d like to share with me?  

Great. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the check in process and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you for your feedback and thank you again so much for joining us today. 

Have a great rest of your day.
