# Call Center Integration - Sprint 0 Product Brief Template 

[Link to Epic]

## Problem Statement

### Current Experience ###

* There are places in the app where we display phone numbers to call the VA.  A user is able to tap on the phone numbers to initiate a call.  When the number called is the VA Call Center, the call will be initiated and it will look to the Call Center like any other call coming through.

### Desired Outcomes ###

* We would like to have the ability for phone calls to the VA Call Centers initiated to pass along additional information to the Call Center system to identify the call as coming from the VA Mobile App.  This will allow the Call Center to better help the Veteran by providing more specific help.

## Assumptions and Level of Confidence

1. What assumptions are we making about this problem?  How confident are we about these assumptions?

## Risks

    1.  Are there steps we can take to mitigate these risks?

## Business Goals

## Roadmap

**V1**

* What scope would be included in the v1/MVP?  

**V2 and beyond**

## Technical Approach

*	Are there other VA groups or tools we need to work with?

## Notes
- specifically from Claims Status page
-  Send Veteran ID info 
-  Send info about what the Veteran just experienced in the app
-  Send Info about what part of the app the Veteran called from
-  Send Veteran to the correct group in the Call Center directly, skip first layer of phone tree
-  Allowing VA to call the Veteran back if the hold time is long (more about Call Center ability than mobile app)

Need to hear from Klay more about the technical details of how the mobile app would integrate with systems.
