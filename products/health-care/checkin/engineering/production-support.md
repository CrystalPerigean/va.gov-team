## Incident Response Plan (Production Support)

### Summary
Here is the current production support guidance for Check-in Experience team:

- CIE Engineers will have a sprint rotation to provide production support
- CIE Engineers will schedule the production support hours to be able to complement the support hours of CHIP team. Currently, that schedule is M - F, 1pm - 8pm Eastern Time
- The support tasks for CIE Engineers are to proactively monitor the datadog dashboards ([Links](#links), [#Check-in-monitoring]() [#check-in-experience-apm](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C02U11L00TF) and [#check-in-production-support](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C02UP02HHGX) slack channels.
    - for any alerts in #check-in-experience-apm channel, perform initial debugging into the Sentry error message and the corresponding downstream error. If needed, alert the TEVI team by sending a message in #check-in-experience-engineering slack channel and tagging Charley and/or Michael Kimball
    - for any anomaly in stats or error traces, alert the TEVI team by sending a message in #check-in-experience-engineering slack channel
    - for any questions or issues in #check-in-go-live channel, perform initial debugging to identify/narrow down root cause. If needed, include Shane or Andy (for VistA, vista-api info), Rob Durkin (for VEText info) or Check-in Experience Team's frontend & backend engineers (for CHIP/LoROTA) or TBD (for Clinician Workflow info).
- This data should automatically be posted in the production support channel daily

    - Sidekiq enqueued: shows the jobs currently enqueued in Sidekiq. This can increase if vista-apis start behaving anomalously (slow or erroring out)
    - Puma Backlog: if it starts increasing, puma canâ€™t keep up with the incoming requests

    - ignore the logs from `project-chipapi-cwsacrificiallambda-prod`
    - sometimes, one of the sidekiq job (eg: `PreCacheAppointmentsByClinicJob`) fails due to error with vista-api. It usually is re-queued to run in 2 mins so an error in itself is not cause for concern. But if there are more than a few errors, that should be reported and looked into.
6. vista-api: [https://tevi.ddog-gov.com/dashboard/pa4-jzg-492/vista-api?from_ts=1653412462199&to_ts=1653416062199&live=true](https://tevi.ddog-gov.com/dashboard/pa4-jzg-492/vista-api?from_ts=1653412462199&to_ts=1653416062199&live=true)
    - Look for REST errors and RPC Socket Timeout and Connection Refused
7. vets-api: [https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/dashboard/zps-5fk-azw/check-in-vets-api](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/dashboard/zps-5fk-azw/check-in-vets-api)
    - shows numbers for check-ins and pre check-ins as well as other data on various controllers and services calls
    - look for any anomalous data (any counts lower than expected, or response measurements higher than normal).
