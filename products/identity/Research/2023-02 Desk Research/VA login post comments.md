Why ask for SS number. Last four is all I need for most things I access..I read a lot of comments,mostly negative, are you doing anything about them?
2. Tim January 12, 2023 at 9:03 pm
I must agree with the MASSIVE frustration. WE don’t want more accounts and log-ins. (VA.gov, IDme, My ID, myhealthyvet, ad nauseum.) We want solutions. We want fair adjudications to our disability claims in a timely manner. The VA has not done a very good fiduciary job at its core missions, disability claims and healthcare for injured veterans. Somehow, like all other agencies, you really lost your way.
3. Christopher Majors January 12, 2023 at 7:18 pm
YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME, I BEEN LOCKED OUT FOR OVER FIVE MONTHS AND COUNTING AND IT STILL DOESN’T WORK. Is it way to slow down things getting processed for BLACK VETERANS or another way to lose us in SYSTEM. CAN’T GET ONLINE, HAVE TO GO IN PERSON TO PERSON TO GET ,SOMETHING DONE.
4. Robert Wetick January 12, 2023 at 2:37 pm
Agree with all comments made. Followed “establish account” procedures and ended up with a blank page with no selection options to go further. Why not hire a professional to start from scratch. The VA has lost all credibility in making veteran’s access easy.
5. David Werner January 12, 2023 at 1:38 pm
VA.gov, IDme, My ID, myhealthyvet, ad nauseum. How many freaking Logins are going to keep being the ONLY one that I need? Oops, I didn’t scroll down to see that NOBODY thinks this is good. It seems to be an annual event for “THE” login. Who designs these and do they get any veteran input?
You have my name , social, everything to identify me! My info has been hacked in 4 prominent GOV sites, and a handful of commercial sites.
So please just identify me as “FRUSTRATED”.

Necesito saber el estado de una solicitud de pensión conectado al servicio. Lleva más de un año y todavía no se donde estamos.

Is this a cruel joke?
8. Edward T Murphy January 12, 2023 at 10:01 am
This is disgusting, frustrating and, it seems, hopeless. I’ve already wasted over an hour trying to get REverifed (why I have to REverify I’ll never know). So who or what is the genius that came up with this system designed to kill veterans?
This seems like another ingenious way the VA uses to cull the herd of veterans. By instituting a mind numbing, frustrating and Blood Pressure raising Byzantine system that is designed to worsen a veterans health by stressing us to the max. The VA should just poison our meds, that would be much easier and less painful for us vets.
9. claven e johnson January 12, 2023 at 9:56 am
Too many log ins already. Really confusing to get where you want to go. Stop the madness
10. Edward T Murphy January 12, 2023 at 9:50 am
This system sucks. I have been verified by MYhealthevet, I have been verifed, in person, at my VAMC and now I have to reverify an account I’ve had for years? I uploaded my ID but it couldn’t veryufy my docs so go fck yourselves you motherfckers. Fck you!

What does the TSA pre-check do ???
   - Martin January 12, 2023 at 1:47 pm
   Warner,
   The TSA Pre-check is a program that lets you be “validated in advance” by having this “TSA Pre-check” shown on your plane ticket. This lets you go through the quick security line at the airport vs the normal line. This is because you have already been “vetted” so you are less of a threat. The fast line has less security processes as well for you to do. Just makes life a bit easier if/when you travel sir. Hope that helps.
      - James Dean January 17, 2023 at 9:23 pm
      Not free for veterans, still have to pay.
12. Claud e. Pipkin jr January 12, 2023 at 6:40 am
“Easy Access to VA Products, Services”…………..lollllll…………Is that an Oxymoron
13. James B Hudson January 12, 2023 at 12:41 am
Myhealthevet website DOES NOT WORK! Need someone who will answer VA phones with knowledge how to help with connecting Veterans to Myhealthevet! It is just quite ridiculous that the VA website and anything IT related with the VA appears to be the most non-helpful government enitity for our veterans and military men and women.
14. Jon Husted January 11, 2023 at 9:36 pm
How do I get a Vet ID card? I live near the old Ft. Ord base VA office.
15. Alfred Stone January 11, 2023 at 9:36 pm
Wow, I thought the new Health Vet login was a pain, but after reading the comments about the “login.gov” ,I want nothing to do with it. I have no problems with the Health Vet login so please leave it alone. Unfortunately it appears that IT people can nor leave things alone. The new process is worse than being hacked. I remember “the new coke” and the mess windows made when they came up with a new windows that never worked. Remember “KISS” keep it simple stupid. Some people never learn. Many of our veterans can not keep up with the constant change of todays technology. I’m in my seventies and I struggle with my flip phone.
From what I read in the comments section no one will read this, but what the hell, here it is.
16. Bennie Conner January 11, 2023 at 9:09 pm
I hope the new VA director will do things for the benefit of all of us Veterans. Many things at the VA are more fitted to provide jobs for the staff than for the benefit of the Veterans. I have tried to question the performance of the travel personnel to have them spitefully hold my travel pay for nearly a month, thus far. The “in manual review “ is used to delay our payment, which the BTSSS is supposed to facilitate…!
17. Maelene Leake January 11, 2023 at 8:40 pm
Do spouses of dead Vietnam vets have any benefits under the Pact act.
18. carl blanda January 11, 2023 at 8:23 pm
How is it that there is a need to build more and more applications? Do we really need them? Is the desire to built greater than the need? More isn’t always better.
   - Richard January 12, 2023 at 2:34 pm
   Only to justify and more job security.

I quit trying again! Trying to upload my ID has me in knots! I have pictures and I email them and bubkas! Bubkas to this effing crap! Make it simpler!!!
21. Ralph riggs January 11, 2023 at 7:38 pm
This is b s. It never works and is a rip off. Assistance for medical problems is there, but difficult to obtain.

How can I get a TSA pre check?
23. James D. Turnbull January 11, 2023 at 6:40 pm
Just answer the GD phone. Mostly I’ve had problems with the VA trying to get help. I tried to get just an ID card. Nope!! Just so I could get discounts at various businesses. Nope. Go e mai from VA for national park’s entrance??? It never quits. I have trouble falling in the last year I have fallen and broke my arm, elbow, knocked out my two front teeth, fell here two weeks ago broke my knee cap and in a knee brace for perhaps another two to three weeks. Called VA about get the Lifeline necklas hum no don’t think so.
So more Bull Sht, tried to post but sez I’ve already posted! Other comments say you never responded ?

What does “Your comment is awaiting moderation.” mean?
26. Paul Wallpe January 11, 2023 at 8:13 am
Does anyone read these comments? I can relate to each comment. We are asked to respond to questionnaires, but we get no sign that anyone ever reads our responses. There is a small group that use this forum to provide themselves with a job; they do nothing more. Who is served by this forum?
27. Roy Erickson January 11, 2023 at 8:01 am
This doesn’t work. I tried last year – and it wouldn’t accept my driver’s license. There is no one to call or email to fix it. I only go to MyHealtheVet anyway – and I have no problem logging in there with the name and password I’ve always used. You are gonna have to make it simple and not be constantly changing the password or sending a new verification code. I have no use for login.gov. This is stupid dumb for older folks. rd
28. Randy Logsdon January 11, 2023 at 7:29 am
If I want my healthy vet I will go to that site.
I’ve tried your one log in for 10s of sites maybe 100s. It is not easy. It literally took me days to get a password reset. First the site appeared on reachable. When I finally got through I could not receive a text with a stupid code to continue. I tried many many times. I tried again days later. Not without a ton of effort did I finally get through.
Now, I wasn’t trying to get through to my healthy vet. I was trying to get through to a VA Dept that sent me a postal mail from the VA uptake center. Do you know the department to choose once you finally log in? I don’t and I didn’t. Too many options to choose from. I never got to see the letter online. You see, I’m overseas and did not get the postal mail. All I had was a picture of the envelope and days later the contents. Sent to me by a family member.
The letter was a dud and did not pertain to me. But, I could not access it through this uneasy site that you think is easy.
For your information, I am 100%total and permanent for a reason. The VA is becoming more and more complicated. Soon I will not be able to use any VA site.
I can’t keep up with the ever changing Cellphones. Microsoft won’t allow me to upgrade my PC without doing a major overhaul. Most likely I won’t be able to understand windows anymore with windows 11. I ain’t upgrading my desktop. I’m done with windows and PCs. The phone I’m on now is my last. I simply can’t figure it out. Did I tell you, I’m 68 and very handicapped. You should have handicapped log in. Handicapped surfing and or navigation whatever it might me called to navigate the VA site. You are alienating disabled Vets. Aren’t you supposed to give give way to disable people? You know, ramps, special bathroom stalls, etc. Start making special access for VA sites.
   - Roger January 11, 2023 at 7:50 pm
   Absolutely agree with you
29. Need live in person phone help with Login.Gov.Need Phone number January 10, 2023 at 11:36 pm
NEED LIVE IN PERSON PHONE HELP TO GET LOGIN.GOV TO WORK, NOT CHAT-BOT BUT A REAL LIVE PERSON ON A REAL PHONE.
IF LOGIN.GOV IS FOR VETS THEY NEED TO GET A PHONE HELP PHONE NUMBER OR STOP THEIR WEBSITE AND GO BACK TO WHAT OTHER SCAM THEY WERE N BEFORE.
30. JOHN GUSTAFSON January 10, 2023 at 11:20 pm
IT DOES NOT F****** WORK
Neither ID.ME or myHealtheVet (i am registered and have passwords for each) will login reliably.
Get rid of your linked Iogin information.
I know you are working with numbers in the millions however mass blind changes simply do not work.
Each government organization communicating or log in through ID.ME must be tested with world wide test on internet capable devices not linked to any government websites.
My website looks trivial because I want only individuals who know the structure to access the site.

32. Keith CARSON January 10, 2023 at 6:25 pm
I have had nothing but trouble signing in to my heath ever since you started messing around with all this new login crap. We are not all tech wizards. Make things simple!!!
33. Donald M. Johnson January 10, 2023 at 6:20 pm
Trying to get travel pay is now a nightmare. What was wrong with the old simple system?
How many old veterans don’t have computers or smart phones?
34. COOP January 10, 2023 at 5:46 pm
it doesn’t work all the time
…
other times it is off-line & unavailable

You have no idea what some people have to go through just to use tech. It is not easy. Unfortunately, your not listening and neither is the VA. Your comment is out of line.

every time I try to sign in…they want me to change my PW.. whats up with that..how about using one PW all year and change next year..
if their is a breach then i could see changing PW..
37. William E. Calvert January 10, 2023 at 2:48 pm
I tried to post a comment previously, but it disappeared on me. What I do not need is yet another complicated process or extended password to deal with. I like signing in to MyHealtheVet as it is.
38. Robert N Horey January 10, 2023 at 2:47 pm
This is so effing convoluted! I signed into Myhealthevet and had no problems until, Login.gov, IDme.gov Login.gov. DoD.gov. I tried repeatedly to send my Drivers license only to receive” something to say they weren’t working now, try again””. You have to come up with something simpler. What you have now is crap. All vets are not ITs or computer literate. Make the system easier!!!!
39. Michael D Curtin January 10, 2023 at 2:35 pm
Every time it has me enter a verification code, I go back to retrieve it from my phone and I go back to enter it , it makes me start all over in an endless loop, to where I can’t do anything.
40. Charles Braden January 10, 2023 at 2:33 pm
I am an 84 year old Vet in the Ariaona Veterians Home in Phoenix AZ close to the Vets Clinic and Hospital, where I get all my healthcare. I have been here for one and one half years.
Can you help me ? I have been disabeled since 2014. I do not have a drivers license, a passport. or any other form of ID except my Veterans Healthcare Card.
I have my own phone and computer which I use everyday. I have tried everything to be able to access the Vets apps but have not been able because the lack of having the required ID.
I would like to be able to use the Vets Apps to keep track of my appointments and medications refills and other information.
Please respond
   - Stanton H Kieffer January 10, 2023 at 11:07 pm
   Dear Charles,
   I am a 92 Veteran and go to the Hospital ? VA in Phoenix and I Hold a extra grade license for the VA health program. I am sure that if you ? call the library in the hospital and talk to the librarian there she may be able to help you.
   God Bless

41. franklin briggs January 10, 2023 at 1:48 pm

42. Lynn January 10, 2023 at 12:46 pm
Login.gov is definitely not easy to use. On Monday I spent four hours signing on, being kicked off, redirected and cut off.
