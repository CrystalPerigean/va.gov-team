# Research Plan for Usability Testing, VBA Facility pages Veteran-Facing, June 2023

## Background

VBA regional office websites are being modernized in order to replace the legacy pages maintained in Teamsite. This effort is intended to incorporate a consistent content model, as well as better support for mobile usage and accessibility.

### OCTO Objectives

This research aligns with the following [OCTO Objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme).

North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

Goals:
1. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
1. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Benefit use and enrollment
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey 
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and benefits from the VBA throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Finding something to do, Finding a place to live)
- Taking care of myself (Managing primary care and chronic health issues > Disability Compensation)
- Putting down roots (Revisiting housing, Taking care of my family, Saving for my retirement, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Retiring (Finding additional sources of income)

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the new modernized design for VBA regional office sites**.

### Outcome
Learnings will help refine the design of the pages before piloting an MVP with 7 sites.

### Research questions
1. Do Veterans understand which services are available at this location?
1. Do Veterans understand how services are delivered at this location?
     1. In-person, virtual, or by phone
     1. With or without appointments
     2. Hours of operation--for the office vs. only for specific service
3. Do Veterans understand the actions they need to take to receive the service (make an appointment, walk-in, bring required documents, etc.)?
4. What do Veterans know about VA regional benefit offices?
     1. What tasks do Veterans expect to do at VA regional benefit offices?
     2. What do Veterans expect to find on a web page about a VA regional benefit office?
5. What feedback do Veterans have on content, organization, and length of the regional benefit office web page?
6. When prompted with specific tasks, do Veterans navigate to the correct service accordion and find the correct next steps? 
    7. What do they do if they don't find an applicable service accordion on the page? 
8. Do Veterans interact with any of the 3 action links near the top of the page? If so, which ones? Are these "top tasks"?
9. How do Veterans react to seeing 2 phone numbers?
     1. Which phone number would they use and why? 
     2. What do they expect when they call?
10. What do Veterans expect to find under "Services offered"?
     1. Do Veterans expect to find different details for different services?

### Hypotheses
1. Veterans will learn what they can do at a VA benefit office by looking at the new web page.
2. Veterans will learn how to plan for a visit to a VA benefit office from the new web page.
3. ???

## Method	
We will conduct **usability testing** to guide research participants through a click-through prototype. We would like most participants to be on mobile devices. We will be unable to accommodate screen reader users because the prototype won't be accessible.

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like **Zoom transcripts please**. 

### Ideas for Prototype:
- Make the 3 action links at the top of the page go somewhere
- Make the 3 links under "On this page" work
- Include some content under the "Limited services and hours" additional info component, if including it

### Ideas for Conversation Guide
- Warm up questions about what regional benefit offices are, whether you've been to one before, what you might do there or have done there before (and what happened, what do you wish you had known before going),  what you'd do before your visit (search for info online? where?)
- If you wanted to visit a VA benefit office near you, what would you do? (wayfinding via google? VA.gov > facility locator?) 
- How could you find out whether it could help you with X? _(applying for disability compensation?)_
- Let's suppose that Google/VA.gov led you to the page that I'm going to show you. Open prototype, and tell me your impressions of this page (regional benefit office). could add caveat that this is representative of a page but not completely accurate info.
- How could you figure out whether it could help you with X?
- To make this happen, what would you do next (check hours, make appt, figure out how to get there, learn what to bring and gather it)
- How to find the benefit office in the building? call?
- How could you talk to someone at the VA about whether the VA will pay for more school for you?  
- Ask to do a task related to a service that's not available at this location, and see what they do
- Ask at end after saw prototype: What do you think you can do from this VA office?
