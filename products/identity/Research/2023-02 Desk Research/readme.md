# About this Research

[Research repo ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/256)

## Research Goals

### Analtics
- understand the capabilities of the mobile devices that are logging into VA.gov - especially camera capabilities, since login.gov has a camera quality requirement when taking a picture of your ID for account verification
- identify how many mobile devices log in using a verified account
- use that data to discover if mobile device capabilities correlates at all with verified account use

### Comment Scraping
-Better understand some of veterans’ frustrations with logging in and credentialing


## Key Findings

### Analytics
The top logged in mobile devices have cameras that meet login.gov’s requirements.
Google Analytics data shows that VA.gov’s mobile users are more likely to be Apple devices. A smaller majority of unverified account logins are also made from Apple devices.
The Google Analytics dataset shows the majority of mobile devices that don’t meet login.gov’s camera requirements are logging in with a verified account.
Devices with cameras that don’t meet, or just meet, login.gov’s requirement are statistically less likely to log in with a verified account.

### Blog comments
During analysis we sorted the comments into the following categories:

Number of account credential options overwhelms some of the commenters
Requirements to switch credentialing systems frustrates some of the commenters
Required information or documentation to verify account seems like a repeat process that some have already gone through. Also the ID verification process is prone to failure
General credential system issues with various CSPs
Login.gov’s ease (or difficulty) of use
Multi factor authentication causes difficultly with logging in
Technology proficiency and accessibility concerns
Workarounds used when unable to login
