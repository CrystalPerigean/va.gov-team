- At the top of the page, a user should be able to quickly learn about disclaimers about this domain.
- A user should be able to see a list of all of their lab and test results, ordered chronologically by date collected. 
- Each should include:
  - Category (e.g. Pathology, Microbiology, etc)
  - Title of the lab result or report (if available)
  - Date collected
  - Ordering provider
- A user should be able to click into each entry to get more details.
  
### Details view
- The H1 of the details view should be the lab or test type
- Where possible and clinically permissable, transform text to make a note easier to read
- From the top of the page, a user should be able to print a note, or download it as either a PDF or TXT file
- A user should be able to print or download a result/report as either a PDF or TXT file.
- When a lab results includes multiple tests, such as a CMP, the tests should be presented as accordions, with one test result per accordion.
- If a result does no include mutliple tests, the results should be laid out flat on the page.
- When there is reference range included, a user should be able to easily see when their lab result falls above or below the normal range.

## Research to date

### Findings from card sort

_Cards included:_ 
  - Labs/ test cards: Antibody test, Blood sugar tests, Blood test, COVID-19 test result, Lab/ test results, Pathology results
  - Imaging cards: Dental x-rays, MRI results, Radiology results and images, Ultrasound results
  - Vitals cards: Blood pressure, Height/weight, Vitals

_Findings:_
- Labs/ test category was the most common category, and roughly 52% of all cards were grouped in that category across the 13 participants
- Imaging cards were combined with labs/ test cards approximately 48% of the time (25 out of 52). 
- Vitals card were grouped under "About me/ Personal information" most often (25 out of 39, or 64% of the time), and were only grouped with Labs/ Tests 6 out of 39 times (15%).  (click below for larger image)

**Participants had a range of interpretations for some medical terminology, like "pathology results", indicating misunderstanding of some health terms found in current medical records.** 

It is possible that the technical language in the labs/ tests section may be confusing for some Veterans and Caregivers. For example: 

_Pathology results:_ Responses were not consistent. Amongst those asked (n=11), most understood to be relating to fluids in the body, such as blood, that were drawn out to search for indicators of an illness, cancer, infection, etc. Two participants stated they did not know what pathology results were, while two others included things like x-rays or toxins like drugs or alcohol in their definitions.

### Desk research

Q: Do users expect to find blood sugar, cholesterol (lipid panel) and blood clotting times in their vitals or in lab and tests?
- A: After additional research and finding test accounts that displayed the full gamut of tests, Blue Button reports already include blood sugar and cholesterol tests as part of labs and tests.

Q: Do users expect to find imaging (X-rays, MRI, CT scan) in labs and tests?
- A: After additional research and finding test accounts that displayed the full gamut of tests, Blue Button reports already include imaging as part of labs and tests.

## Questions to answer

- Is there a technical reason why the imaging studies are not listed in the labs and tests section on the existing site? 
- How should we include images, if we do at all? Can we link to images from their report, rather than creating an entirely new section for images?
- Is there a business or technical reason that would not allow us to include microbiology, electrocardiogram, pathology reports in lab and test results?
- Can users understand which result to click into from the list view to find what they are looking for?

### Data Type: Cardiology [VA Electrocardiogram (EKG) Reports]
*Note: Based on notice within the Blue Button report and documentation on MHV, these are no longer being updated, but historical records are available*

##### Data Source(s):

2/3/2023 Updated based on a Jan 2023 email thread

"Cardiology images such as EKGs and echocardiograms are going to be in VistA Imaging. I believe there is an API that I know allows for importing images into VistA Imaging, but may also allow for pulling images from VistA Imaging. Shane may know more about this particular API’s functionality.
 
"As for cardiology reports, these would be available via standard CPRS RPCs, for example “ORWP REPORTS TEXT” (https://vivian.worldvista.org/dox/Remote_Procedure_ORWRP_REPORT_TEXT.html)
 
"AVS pulls reports data via the aforementioned RPC."

##### Fields
