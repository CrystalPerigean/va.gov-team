## Notes:
- Clean up agenda items from Identity Comms meetings:
  - Sitewide Content is currently adding feedback from Tom and John to FAQs
  - Redirected and retired "How to get a premium DSL account"
  - Confirmed that no VA.gov pages will link to eBenefits that require DSL by time of sunset
  - We are still waiting on Login.gov to giv us additional info on in-person proofing and account creation process

- VA.gov static pages progress is captured but other efforts from LGA and Core team is not because it's not clear what is comms and there is no plan we are following
- Blog post: Carl is going to finish a draft by Monday and he will meet with Amber and Charlye from Core on Friday 5/5 to go over preliminary findings and work them into the post
- Make sure Clayton's research readout loops in Sitewide Content team
- Email drafts - look at after Clayton's research wraps up
 

## Next steps:
- Content team will send updates to agenda to Michelle

- Reach out to Core team to setup a readout once they are finished with synthesis
