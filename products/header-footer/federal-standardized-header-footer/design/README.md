## Decision log

### Header decisions

| Problem/Question/Challenge | Decision | Date |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Thing 1 |   |   |


### Footer decisions

#### Assumptions
* The "Contact us" header in the footer may be a bit misleading. Will need to validate through research. Is the expectation of "Contact us" that I, as a user, am directly contacting VA

| Problem/Question/Challenge | Decision | Date |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| "Find a VA location" in the footer | Double-check analytics, but likely remove it | 3/21/2023  |
| "Veteran Crisis Line" in the footer |  | 3/21/2023  |
| "Contact us" in the footer |  | 3/21/2023  |
| "Resources and support" in the footer | This is not a contact mechanism. This is a resource mechanism. | 3/21/2023  |
| "Chat with us" in the footer | This is not a way to contact us in-and-of itself. | 3/21/2023  |
