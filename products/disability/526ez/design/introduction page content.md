File for disability compensation with VA Form 21-526EZ 

Equal to VA Form 21-526EZ (Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits).

Use this form to file for disability benefits for an illness or injury that was caused by—or got worse because of—your active military service. This page describes what you need to do to file a new claim or a claim for increased disability compensation.


> **Toxic exposure and PACT Act**
> 
> The PACT Act is a new law that expands benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances by adding to the list of conditions we can automatically assume (or “presume”) was caused by your service. **If this applies to you, we encourage you to file for benefits now.** If you do so before August 10, 2023, and we grant your application, we’ll likely backdate your benefits to the date of the bill signing. This means we’ll pay you the amount you would have received from August 10, 2022 to the date we grant your application.

Follow the steps below to file a claim for a new or secondary condition or for increased disability compensation.

1. Determine if this form is for you 

This form is for you if you’ve served (on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training), you have a current illness or injury (known as a condition) that affects your mind or body, and:
- You got sick or injured while serving (this is called a service-connected disability), **or**
- You had an illness or injury before you served and serving made it worse, **or**
- A service-connected illness or injury you already have has caused a new injury or illness
This form is for filing a new claim or a claim for increased disability compensation for a claim decided more than one year ago. [Get more information about eligibility for disability compensation.](https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/)

If you are filing a new claim after an initial claim for the same or similar benefit was previously decided AND you have new and relevant evidence, you can [file a supplemental claim](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/supplemental-claim/). 

If you disagree with a VA decision, you can [request a decision review](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/). 

In addition to this form, there are other forms you may wish or need to complete related to disability benefits. If you apply here online, you will have the option to include in your application the necessary forms for if you are:
- Claiming Individual Unemployability 
- Claiming posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including based on a personal assault
- Authorizing the release of your medical records to VA

You may consider submitting other forms if you wish to claim:
- Specially Adapted Housing or a Special Home Adaptation
- Auto allowance
- Auto adaptive-equipment grant
- Aid and Attendance because you’re in a nursing home
- Additional benefits because you or your spouse needs Aid and Attendance
- Dependents

> **Are you a currently on active duty as a service member?**
> 
> Service members who have an illness or injury that was caused or made worse by their active duty service, can use this form to file for disability benefits 90 to 180 days before they leave the military through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. 
> 
> **Note:** You’ll need to submit service treatment records for the current period of service as well as a [Separation Health Assessment – Part A Self-Assessment](https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/dbq_publicdbqs.asp) as part of your claim so we can request your VA exam. (We estimate that it will take you at least 30 minutes to complete this form, and we recommend you download and fill out this form on a desktop computer or laptop then return to this form to upload.)
> 
> After you file your claim, you’ll need to be available to complete an exam for 45 days after your claim is submitted. [Learn more about Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD)](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/when-to-file/pre-discharge-claim/).

> If you are granted benefits, your benefits will be effective as of either the date we received your claim or the date that documentation shows a change in your condition that supports the level of compensation.
> 
> If your condition was present when you separated from the military, and we receive your claim before or within one year of that separation, the effective date will be from the day following the date of your separation.
> 
> **When you start your application here and now, you’ll declare your intent to file. This will reserve a potential effective date for when you could start getting benefits.** You have 1 year from the day you submit your intent to file to complete your application.



3. Decide what you’ll claim and gather information

Your disability compensation will be determined based on the nature and symptoms of the condition, severity and duration of the symptoms, and the impact of the condition and symptoms on your employment. 

Each service-connected condition will be assigned a rating from 0% to 100% based on documentation. If you have already been granted benefits, and are filing a claim because your condition has worsened (this is called a claim for increase), you might want to check to see if you’re already receiving the maximum disability rating for your condition. You can do this by signing in and [viewing your claim letters](https://staging.va.gov/track-claims/your-claim-letters).

While processing your claim we will review relevant medical records that you identify and authorize us to (you can give us this permission when you file here). These may include records from Federal facilities such as VA medical centers, State or local government facilities, and/or private doctors or hospitals. In some cases if we need additional documentation we may also ask you to have an exam to help us rate your disability.

We strongly encourage you to submit documentation as soon as you can to help us understand how your injury or illness is connected to your service, and how the condition impacts you and your ability to work. If we previously granted you benefits, and your condition has worsened, we need documentation that shows that increase in severity and the effect that worsening has had on you and your ability to work.


> **Toxic exposure and PACT Act**
> 
> To get a disability rating, we need to see that your condition connects to your military service. For many conditions we need documentation to see this, but for some conditions we can automatically assume (or “presume”) that your service caused your condition. **If you have what we call a presumptive condition, we don’t need documents showing service caused the condition.** 
>    
> The PACT Act is a new law that expands benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances by adding to the list of presumptive conditions. **If this applies to you, we encourage you to file for benefits now.** If you do so before August 10, 2023, and we grant your application, we’ll likely backdate your benefits to the date of the bill signing. This means we’ll pay you the amount you would have received from August 10, 2022 to the date we grant your application.
>   
> To support a claim for presumptive service connection, you only need to submit documentation showing you served in a location and/or you have a current condition that qualifies you for the presumption. [Learn more about the PACT Act and what is now presumptive](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/)
   
   

To support your claim, you can upload documentation such as:
- VA medical records and hospital records that relate to your claimed condition or that show your disability has gotten worse
- Private medical records and hospital reports that relate to your claimed condition or that show your disability has gotten worse
- Supporting statements from family, friends, employers, coworkers, clergy, or law enforcement personnel with knowledge about how and when your conditions occurred or got worse and how it affects you and your ability to work
If your claim involves a condition that was made worse by service, please provide any information or documentation regarding the condition before your entry into service. 

In addition to asking you to provide information about your condition, we will also ask you about your service and other types of pay you may be receiving (retired, separation, and/or disability severance pay).
