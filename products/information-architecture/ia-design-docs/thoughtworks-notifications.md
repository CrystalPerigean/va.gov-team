### Meetings Notes and Background Info

6/17/20 - Design Intent meeting
- Sender email address 
  - may be helpful to do some early thinking around whether you want to classify different types of emails with different "from" email addresses (i.e. confirmation@va.gov, benefit-application@va.gov, notification@va.gov, submission-status@va.gov, etc)
  - Agree that allowing users to reply to the email with questions is best, but if that is not possible, ensure there is content that indicates that and a bounce back email if they do try
- Would love to see mobile and plain text versions of the mock to show how content hierarchy lays out
- Ensure that subject line is clear and concise for what it is and provides trust
- Consider what content may need to be added to the confirmation page in regards to "You will receive an email confirmation..."
- Consider adding text to check status CTA that indicates they will need to log in
- Feedback documented here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/10175

6/11/20 - Kick-off Email notifications
- this will be the initial email, how/will we need to engage with vsp with every email?
- email sent after 526 successful form submission, this is in addition to the physical letter they get and the online confirmation page
- this establishes an email template and a messaging template for future confirmation type emails
- will need to sync between the email content, confirmation page and physical letter - this will require syncing with Andrea S and team for any potential 526 confirmation page changes and PW for any other static content
- we may have different email addresses, one in profile and one on the application - confirm which one to the email will go to
- no preferences to be managed since this is more "transactional" in nature, preferences functionality will come later when optional communications are added
- where will this content be managed?
  - there's a notifications interface, but not planned to be used right now, used by small subset of users
  - domain, there will be external providers, but mostly internal, need separate discussion with Mikki and Meg
  - content not stored in drupal, it may eventually integrate with it though



5/26/20 - Kick-off on broad notifications work (VA Notify)
- There's a mess of notifications, no way to ensure they are quality, consistent, and have our voice, and its slow (mail)
- Idea is to build a "notifications platform" - provide ability for stakeholders to send notifications
- first phase of work will focus on breadth - a single communication that touches many business lines, i.e. notification of submitted online application
  - transactionally triggered
  - not sure if it will be CMS
- second phase planned to add depth - i.e. many communications for a single business line
- preference management - depends on initial focus, the idea is that transactional doesn't require management or opt-out
- focus will be based on initial research
