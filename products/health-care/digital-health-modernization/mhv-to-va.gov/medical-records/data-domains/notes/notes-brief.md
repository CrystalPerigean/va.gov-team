## Description of domain

### Notes
Today, a user can review their notes as part of an MHV Blue Button reporting by choosing to include the category called VA Notes.

#### Progress notes
VA Notes pull in all notes of type Progress Note (PN) dating back to 2013. Progress notes are written by clinical staff and describe a patient's status during a hospitalization, outpatient visit, or other healthcare encounter.

#### Consult notes
VA Notes pull in all notes of type Consult Result (CR) dating back to 2013. Consult result notes are assosciated with consult requests. One provider makes a request for another provider to provide a consultation for a patient for a particular issue. Once that consultation has been completed, an associated consult result is written, signed, and placed in the patient's notes.

More info: https://www.va.gov/vdl/documents/clinical/cprs-consult_request_tracking/consum.pdf

#### Encounter notes
Encounter notes are not currently pulled into MHV.

Encounter notes result from a provider entering encounter information about a particular patient visit. This information is used to give workload credit to the provider and is also used for billing purposes. Encounter infromation is also tied to a particular progress note.

More info: https://www.va.gov/vdl/documents/Clinical/Comp_Patient_Recrd_Sys_(CPRS)/cprsguium.pdf

#### Procedure notes
Procedure notes are not currently pulled into MHV.


#### About note titles
The titles of notes can vary wildly, meaning that a Progress Note could have a title like Procedure Note, or even Consult Note. These note titles can sometimes be quite confusing, although they also have a chance of being quite helpful. **A note's title does not necessarily indicate what type of note (PN or CR) it is under the hood.** 

Any clinical notes in VistA that are not of type PN or CR are not currently pulled into MHV. Therefore, procedure and encounter notes are not, unless they are of type PN and CR, pulled into MHV today.

### Care summaries

#### Discharge summaries
This is called Admission and Discharge Summaries when selecting categories in MHV Blue Button. Admission and Discharge Summaries pulls in all notes of type Discharge Summary.

#### After-visit summaries
Today, MHV Blue Button does not directly include after-visit summaries. An AVS is included as part of appointments as a PDF download today. For every AVS generated, an AVS Progress Note is generated and included in VA Notes. AVS Progress Notes more or less say  "the AVS was printed and given to the patient and is linked to the AVS in VistA Imaging."


## Use Cases

Notes are not just for patients, but also a way for health care members to be informed about patients' health journey. Notes are available 36 hours after completion. What notes are important and useful for patients to access, and what are not? Why are there so many different notes, and how is note different from [after visit summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/assets/AVS-Sample-White-Redacted.pdf)?  

- Procedure note (VA Note in BB): to read about what happened with the procedure and if anything needs to follow up 
- Progress note (VA Note in BB): to read about your health journey and see what's changed. 
- Admissions and Discharge notes (VA Admissions and Discharges in BB): to read about your hospital admissions and discharges.
- After Visit Summary (part of MHV): to get a full picture of all important details during a visit
- Outpatient encounter notes (VA Health Summary)
- Consult notes (VA Health Summary)
- History & physical notes (VA Health Summary)
- Discharge summary notes (VA Health Summary)
- Surgical procedure notes (VA Health Summary)
- Clinical procedure notes (VA Health Summary)

Note what's in BB and what's in Health Summary. We will focus on what currently in BB and the AVS.

**Common Use Cases**

What do people want to use their notes for: 
- To read about what doctors say about their procedures or any hospital stays
- To be informed about their health 
- To support disability claims 

## Requirements

### Title
Care summaries and notes

### Includes  

Only what is currently accessed via BB and the AVS.

  - VA notes
  - Admission & Discharge summaries 
  - After visit summaries

What should not be included?
- Secure message threads should not be included as notes. They should be accessed via the SM interface.

What might need to be included?
- Outpatient encounter notes (VA Health Summary)
- Consult notes (VA Health Summary)
- History & physical notes (VA Health Summary)
- Discharge summary notes (VA Health Summary)
- Surgical procedure notes (VA Health Summary)
- Clinical procedure notes (VA Health Summary)

We need to do some discovery on what these notes are, whether they are different from what is included under VA notes, why there is a difference, and whether we can actually access this data.

### Information architecture
Home > My Health > Health history > Care summaries and notes

### List view

- At the top of the page, a user should be able to quickly learn about the availability of notes. For more info, see https://mhv-syst.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/blue-button-availability
- At the top of the page, a user should be able to quickly learn about disclaimers about this domain.
- A user should be able to see a list of all of their notes, ordered chronologically. 
- Each entry should include the:
  - Note title
    - VA note: Note title
    - Admission & discharge summary: Admission & discharge summary
    - AVS: After-visit summary
  - Date (This should be the date that most closely reflects when the patient had their visit or started their hospital stay)
    - VA note: date of note
    - Admission & discharge summary: Date of admission
    - AVS: Visit date  
  - Location where that note was written
  - Physician
    - VA note: signing physician 
    - A&D: Admitting physician
    - AVS: Provider
- A user should be able to click into each entry to get more details.
  
### Details view
- The H1 of the details view should be the title of the note. 
- Where possible and clinically permissable, transform text to make a note easier to read.
- From the top of the page, a user should be able to print a note, or download it as either a PDF or TXT file. 
- Because each category of the labs and tests is different, details view for each entry will also vary: 
  - VA note
    - Title (H1)
    - Date and time
    - Location
    - Signed by
    - Co-signed by
    - Last updated
    - Date and time signed
    - Note
  - Admission & discharge summary
    - Title (H1)
    - Admission date
    - Location
    - Admitting physician
    - Discharge date
    - Discharge physician
    - Last updated
    - Discharge summary
  - After visit summary
    - Title
    - Visit date
    - Then reflect the AVS as closely as possible - https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/b62e5725d9033be0aefef60bdd8cac6df28164f3/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/assets/AVS-Sample-White-Redacted.pdf

 ### Not for first iteration, requires future usability research
    
  - A user should be able to sort their notes in different ways
    - Chronologically
    - By location, chronologically
    - By signing physician, chronologically
  - A user should be able search Notes to find what they are looking for.
    - A user should be able to search by note metadata, such as note title, signing or co-signing physician, location, or date. 
    - A user should be able to search for keywords in the body content of a note, such as "high blood pressure" or "back pain." A common use case is finding reference to a specific health condition in order to support something like a disability claim.
    - Search results should be ordered chronologically, from newest to oldest, and matches should be highlighted. 
    - The search box can be collapsed to create real estate for the list view of notes.

## Research to date

**Findings from card sort**

Cards that related to clinical notes included: Encounter notes, Admission summary, After visit summary, Discharge summary, Pre-visit summary, Treatment plan, and Progress notes. Below is a screenshot of how participants grouped these cards in relation to the [anchors described in the Generative Research Readout](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/research/2022-10_Generative-research/2022-11-medical-records-readout.md).

Based on these findings and juxtraposed with the interpretations described below, we can assume that participants expect their notes to be associated with a section dedicated to communicating their key issues ("About me") or linked with the appointment in which those notes were produced. Some participants distinguished between notes produced in different contexts, such as in-patient versus outpatient environments (Facility Type), or notes produced by practitioners in different specialties (e.g., by general practitioners). Participants did not consistently associate these notes with lab or test results.

**Participants had a range of interpretations for what might be included in different types of notes.**

_Encounter notes:_ The term "encounter notes" elicited the most negative reactions amongst participants (n=7). Four out of the seven associated encounter notes with mental health in ways that alarmed them. One described an encounter as an interaction between a psychiatrist and someone having a PTSD episode. 

_Pre-visit summary or After-visit summary:_ Responses were not consistent, though most participants understood pre-visit to happen before a visit and after-visit to happen after a visit. Participants were unclear or inconsistent on what information those documents included, and some did not understand how they differed from Admission or Discharge summaries. 

<img width="656" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100814257/204380721-771b81ff-67d1-4941-a6c2-72e0d173c6e1.png">

_Admission summary or Discharge summary:_ Only four participants were probed on these terms. Amongst these participants, Admission and Discharge summaries were associated with a hospital, rather than a clinical visit.

## Questions to answer
- Can we or should we redesign BB PDFs to be consistent with the view experience of the same note and with Health Summary? 
- Is there any information that users have access to for notes via BB or Health Summary that we cannot display in HTML?
- Are there note types we have not accounted for that must be included? Do their fields differ from what we have included above? 
- BB may include a SM as part of Notes today. We do not think we should do this and instead should keep these in SM. Can this be confirmed?
- BB may include Admission notes, Discharge notes as part of VA notes. How do these differ from Admission and Discharge summaries?
- Can users understand which note to click into from the list view to find what they are looking for?

## Additional notes

- Notes from Jenny: On BB, this is called "VA Notes", which includes all notes (progress notes, visit summary, procedure messages...). In CCDA, encounter notes, consultation notes and procedure notes are all separated.
  - So this means we need to decide if we separate them out or keep them together and linked with the healthcare interaction/ occurrence to which they pertain. E.g., link notes with clinic visit, surgery/ procedure, etc. OR if we do it some other way? Has backend implications - need to liaise w/ both Jenny and Eric to understand better. 

**What is a clinical or progress notes? [Source](https://www.gfcounty.nd.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/660/637248972518830000#:~:text=What%20is%20VA%20OpenNotes%3F,document%20care%20and%20services%20performed.)**

After an appointment or hospital stay, your provider and health care team write a note about that visit in your VA EHR. The note is a summary of important issues about your health. Notes have several parts, and may include: 
- A list of medical problems or symptoms 
- What you told your provider, also called the "history"
- Vital signs and physical observations or measurements, such as blood pressure, weight, or heart and lung exams
- Test results such as blood or urine tests, or X-ray reports
- Your provider's views of your health problems, called "Assessment" or "Impression" 
- The recommended treatment plan, called "Plan"
- Suggested follow up needed, such as tests or referrals to a specialist
- Notes about your hospital admission, such as the condition that resulted in an admission, treatment provided.
- Notes about your hospital discharge, such as instructions related to work, physical activity, and follow-up appointments.
