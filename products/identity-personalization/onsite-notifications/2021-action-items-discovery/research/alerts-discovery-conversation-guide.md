## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you, instead we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** It might not behave exactly how you expect. If the prototype doesn't do what you expect, let me know what you expected to happen. 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

[Start recording to the Cloud]

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

1. Can you tell me a little about yourself? (if needed, ask about service history)
2. What device are you joining us on?
3. Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA?
   - If yes: What benefits?  
4. Do you currently, or have you ever, filed a claim or appeal with the VA?
5. (if yes) How do you check for any updates or changes to your benefits?
6. Have you ever used the My VA page on VA.gov? What do you use it for? 
7. How do you manage your benefits?
    - (if needed: do you ever go online?) Where do you go?
8. Do you ever manage your benefits on VA.gov? Tell me about that.
    - (if they haven't mentioned it: Are you familiar with My VA? Tell me about your experience with it)

## Background and questions - 7 minutes

Just a little bit of background before we start - we are working on building a central place for you to recieve any action items, updates or reminders on VA.gov. These could be anything related to health care, benefits or just general announcements. 

1. Let's say the VA has some things related to your benefits that need your attention - what would you call those?
2. What would you expect that type of information to be called?
3. What kind of information would you expect to be on a page like this? 
4. What are some scenarios in your life where you would want a page like this? 
5. Imagine that you do have new [USE THEIR WORD], where would you expect to hear about it? 
6. Where would you expect to find that information on VA.gov? 

## Prototype - 30 minutes 

Great, let's move on. We're now going to take a look at a prototype. I'll share a link with you, and go ahead and pull that up and share your screen with me.

### Logistics: figure out how to share your screen - 5 minutes

- Confirm with the participant that they are using a mobile device with Zoom installed
- If not, backup plan - load VA.gov in a "mobile frame" - open VA.gov in Chrome. Hit Command+Alt+J.  Backup to backup - moderator shares screen.

Let's start by making sure you can figure out how to share your screen on Zoom.

**If they are on an iPhone**
* Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen) If you can’t see the zoom menu, tap anywhere on your screen once and it should appear.
* Tap on Screen
* Tap Zoom
* Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
* Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share 
* IF THEY CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT
   * they can tap "share content" then tap "web URL" and just enter in VA.gov
* For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing   

**If they are on Android**
* Tap "Share"
* Tap "Screen"
* Tap Zoom
* May give a "sensitive info" alert
* May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
* Tap "Start now" (maybe)
* For Android troubleshooting, try here: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen

**Ask participant to be mindful of thinking outloud since you will not be able to see a mouse cursor go through the prototype. If a user is on desktop, have them zoom to 80% to see the full phone screen
**

Just a reminder - we are working with a prototype so it might not behave exactly how you expect. The information shown is not real information, and is completely fictional. If you could pretend that you are 'Kimberly Washington' and that this is your information, that would be great.  

## First task - Scenario - 5 minutes

*Participant should be on first page of the prototype.*

- Now that you’re looking at this prototype, where would you go to find some of the updates we just discussed, starting from here?

*If users DID click on alerts, skip to the fourth task*

*If users clicked on My VA, skip to the third task*

*If users notice the red dot and bell next to 'Alerts', skip to the second task*

3. What is confusing about this?

## Third task - My VA - 7 minutes

Go ahead and click on 'View all alerts.

## Fourth task - Alerts - 10 minutes

Go ahead and scroll through this page and walk me through what you're seeing here. 

1. What are your overall thoughts about this page?
2. Why do you think you are seeing these specific alerts?
3. What information is useful here? 
4. What would make one notification more important than another one?
5. What would you do next with this info?
6. What does it mean to take action on an alert?
7. How far back are you expecting to see your alerts?
8. What do you think works about this page?
9. What do you find confusing here? 
10. What assumptions are you making about this page?
11. What would you change about this page?
12. What is missing on this page? 

Okay, great - any questions or thoughts before we move on?

*If users initially clicked on alerts, loop back to the third task*

## CLOSING QUESTIONS - TIME PERMITTING - 2 minutes

1. How did these pages meet your expectations? 
2. How did these pages not meet your expectations?
3. Do you think you would or would not use these pages when you log in to VA.gov? Why?
    - if no: What would make this page more useful to you?
