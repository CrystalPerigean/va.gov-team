## Research Goals

*Note - part of this research was to figure out what to call this new feature, throughout documentation we have called it 'alerts', 'action items' and 'notifications' - these terms are all referring to the same feature.*

Our team is giving Veterans access to their recent action items by adding recent action items to the My VA dashboard as well as building out a separate page for action items. We aim to understand the best way to implement this new action items feature on VA.gov. This includes:
 
- How do users expect to find their action items? 
- How do users expect to take action on their action items?
- What action items do users expect to see?
- Do users expect their action items to be ordered in a certain way? If so, how?

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to share a high-fidelity prototype. Users were asked to join using their mobile devices (android, iphone and samsung). All users joined on their mobile phones. *Note - we had 2 prototypes available. One for if a user joined via desktop and one for if a user joined via mobile phone.*

### Who we talked to

- 8 total Veterans
- Ages varied from 35-65 (exact demographics unknown)
- 7 out of 8 veterans were currently receiving disability compensation
- 7 out of 8 veterans were enrolled in and using VA health care
- 7 out of 8 veterans had an active appeal
- All 8 veterans were currently receiving some type of benefit (retirement, health care, GI bill etc)
- 2 out of 8 veterans had cognitive considerations
- 8 out of 8 veterans managed their benefits online (using primarily MHV and ebenefits)
- 6 out of 8 visited VA.gov specifically to check their benefits

## Research questions

- What are the most important scenarios that users need to take action on?
- What are the least important action items for users?
- How do people expect to see these action items?
- Where do people expect to see these action items?
- How do people expect their action items to be ordered?
- How do users expect to be able to resolve these action items?
- Do people expect to go to My VA to see notifications?
- Is it useful to have alerts on My VA?
- Is duplication helpful? (indicator + actual notification)
- How do users think of action items? (e.g. a to-do list or more of a notification?)
- What does a 'new' alert mean? (eg when should they see an indicator in the navigation)
- Do users want to see all the alerts theyâ€™ve ever had?
- What should this section be called?? (alerts, notifications, action items??)
- How do people know if a task is complete?
- What information about an action item do people need to see?

## Key Findings

#### Overall

1. Users were very positive about the My VA and Alerts page. All participants said they would use these pages and would find them very useful.
2. 6 out of 8 users expressed that the My VA page should be the first thing they see when they log in.
3. Many participants were surprised and excited at the level of personalized content that was provided on the alerts page and My VA (even though it was a prototype and not their real information).

#### Central Alerts Page
 
 ![alerts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2021-action-items-discovery/research/screenshots/Alerts%20page.png)
 

1. All users were quickly and easily able to find and understand the 'Alerts' link and indicator (red dot) in the navigation.
2. Users easily understood the purpose of the alerts page and why they were seeing the alerts they were seeing.
3. Users were able to easily understand the amount of information shown in an alert and how to take action on said alert (eg clicking on links inside of alerts).
4. All users mentioned redundancy as a welcomed and important feature.
5. Users want their alerts in reverse chronological order (most recent at the top).
6. All users easily understood and liked the term 'Alerts' after they saw it.
7. Users want the ability to see old/expired alerts.
8. Most users want to be able to visually differentiate between read and unread alerts. 4 out 8 participants expected anything that is time-sensitive and expired to 'disappear' all together (e.g. an appointment that has passed).
9. 5 out of 8 users mentioned perceiving the categories of alerts would be helpful (like on the homepage or on My VA). 3 out of 8 mentioned wanting the ability to customize what alerts they see on their alerts page. This included the ability to filter alerts by category or date.

#### Alerts section on My VA

![My VA View All Alerts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2021-action-items-discovery/research/screenshots/My%20VA.png)

1. Users expect there to be information about their alerts on My VA, in addition to a separate alerts page.
2. Users were very confused about *why* specific alerts were shown on My VA. 
3. 7 out of 8 users missed the 'View all alerts' link completely. Many users mentioned wanting it to be further up on the page and called out.

#### Prioritization

1. Though users expect to see personalized alerts - they don't expect prioritization to be automatically specific to them.
2. Users made a clear distinction between an 'action item' (something that the Veteran needs to DO) and a 'notification' (something that the Veteran should know).
3. All users mentioned time-sensitivity and unexpected problems as something to be prioritized.

### Overall

**1. Users were very positive about the My VA and Alerts page. 8 out of 8 participants said they would use these pages and would find them very useful.** Most users specifically called out the name tag area and commented on how they liked the sections included in My VA. All users mentioned that the Alerts page design was clean and easy to understand overall. 

> "It's very easy to navigate - a lot of vets worry about the process and paperwork, this makes it so easy. I just scroll and see everything that I need to see."

> "I like seeing my name, my branch, it gives it a personal feel."

> "It's a big improvement over what it used to be, you know exactly what is going on. You know what's going on, and you haven't been forgotten."

> "It'll be great whenever this does roll out, I'm excited to use it." 

**2. 6 out of 8 users expressed that the My VA page should be the first thing they see when they log in.** Most participants had not used the new My VA page on VA.gov. These users often scrolled through the whole My VA page unprompted and commented that they liked it broken into sections and would find it useful.

> "This is perfect to see right when I log in (My VA). If this is the first page that you see - you don't have to question anything. This makes it really easy. It's like dummy proof."

> "I personally wish that it would default to ...this guy right here (My VA). I'd like that first, and then maybe you have a link to another page that displays all the information on the homepage."

> "If I knew this was the landing page for my VA experience - this would be my first stop shop for all my needs."

**3. Many participants were surprised and excited at the level of personalized content that was provided on the alerts page and My VA (even though it was a prototype and not their real information).** Many Veterans in this study mentioned that the current VA.gov experience is designed for the general Veteran population - not for them specifically. When they saw the My VA page and the alerts page, they immediately began relaying scenarios in which they would use this new personalized format. 

> "What I would like to see, is something that is personalized. What would be really lovely, is once you signed in and you're on your own secure page - it would have personalized alerts. That would be wonderful."

> "It's so personalized! It takes you away from 'You're a veteran. Period'. It's just about you."

> "The way the website is now, it's not designed specifically for my needs, it designed for veterans in general."

### Central Alerts page

**1. All users were quickly and easily able to find and understand the 'Alerts' link and indicator (red dot) in the navigation.** Users understood that the red dot meant that something needed their attention and they easily understood that they could get more information if they clicked on the link. All users were able to navigate to the alerts page with no problem.

> "I like the red dot, it lets me know that there's something there that I need to look at."

> "Obviously the alerts at the top, that's helpful. The red dot automatically draws my attention to it because the column header is alerts. Obviously that tells me that something that I need to look at or needs my attention."

![Indicator](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2021-action-items-discovery/research/screenshots/Alerts%20indicator.png)

**2. Users easily understood the purpose of the alerts page and why they were seeing the alerts they were seeing.** Users understood the layout and content of the page, and were easily able to talk to personal experiences where certain alerts would be helpful.

> "It's pretty great! You don't have to go to different websites to find different information, it's right here at your fingertips."

> "I would use this page - it's all centralized, everything you need to know is in one place."

**3. Users were able to easily understand the amount of information shown in an alert and how to take action on said alert (eg clicking on links inside of alerts).** Many users appreciated the level of information shown. All users understood how to get additional information if they wanted it. There were some specific details (link) that users mentioned would be helpful if they were included (e.g. subject in messages), but overall participants felt that the amount of information was appropriate. 

> "The amount of information is perfect - it's not too much, or too little. "

> "It's easy to read, I like the big bold text and the date and that I can just click to get more information."

**4. All users mentioned redundancy as a welcomed and important feature.** All participants mentioned that they currently receive texts and emails from the VA, and having another channel of communication would be welcomed. Users also mentioned that they would NOT be confused if they received a text about a benefit update, and then came to VA.gov and saw the exact same alert on the website. In fact, they said it would work great for them. Many users mentioned push notifications as something that would be helpful.

> "When you reach my age, you can't have enough reminders."

> "Redundancy is never a bad thing with the VA."

> "I think the more lines of communication the better, I'm working, I'm busy - ... if your prescription is filled, I love to get a text message about it so then I could go pick up my prescription instead of coming home, logging in, and being frustrated."

**5. Users want their alerts in reverse chronological order (most recent at the top).** They easily understood the date on each alert, and mentioned that the order was exactly as expected.

> "I'd like to see recent alerts first. That would make sense - chronological order makes the most sense."

> "They are in sequential order so it does make sense that way too."

**6.All users easily understood and liked the term 'Alerts' after they saw it.** We asked users to pick a title before they saw the prototype and there was a wide variety of what people mentioned. *Just a thought - if we call the page 'Notifications', it might be confusing to a user to go to notification settings and not be able to change anything about the actual 'Notifications' page.*

#### What users thought this page should be called

*Note: some users mentioned multiple titles

- Notifications (3)
- Action items (2)
- Alerts (1)
- Knowledge base (1)
- Status updates (1)
- Benefit summary (1)
- VA notices (1)

**7. Users want the ability to see old/expired alerts.** Users mentioned wanting the ability to see any previous alerts that had past. On the prototype, we show the past alerts for 30 days. Some users found that to be appropriate, but there was some concern about missing an alert if they don't get on VA.gov very often. There were a range of timelines that users mentioned - the most consistent one was 1 year. 

> "Your main page should be your new ones, but there should be an archive in case you want to see them down the line. "

> " I'd want to see them for about a year and a day - generally everything has a year expiration date. Anything that is time constricted with your claim is usually a year. "

> "There should be another page to see all the past alerts."

**8. Most users want to be able to visually differentiate between old and new alerts. 4 out 8 participants expected anything that is time-sensitive and expired to 'disappear' all together (e.g. an appointment that has passed).** When asked what the difference was between 'old' and 'new', many users mentioned that an old alert would be something that they have taken action on - like a form that wasn't completed, but now is OR if an appointment has already passed. 2 participants wanted the ability to dismiss alerts themselves.  When asked to choose what they thought were the most important the two most commonly mentioned thing were the appeal hearing alert and form submission alert, followed closely by appointments. Many users mentioned knowing that their prescription had shipped was NOT important.

> "If we're going to see alerts, we should only see the alerts that are active. If I've already had that appointment, then I would hope that this alert would automatically disappear after that appointment day."

> " If I were to click on the alerts - I'd expect to see what is new and what isn't..."

**9. 5 out of 8 users wanted alerts to be sorted into categories (like on the homepage or on My VA). This included the ability to filter alerts by category or date. 3 out of 8 mentioned wanting the ability to customize what alerts they see on their alerts page.** The current design has a list of alerts that all look exactly the same - there was some concern about alerts getting 'lost'. Some users felt overwhelmed with the number of alerts shown with no differentiation between section or type.

> "Maybe there could be some color variation between different types of alerts, that might help break it up."

> "If they were categorized, that would be really nice. If it's categorized in the same way as the homepage."

> "Vets usually have a lot of appointments and a lot of medications... it would be SO cluttered with those that the important things might get lost."

### Alerts section on My VA

**1. Users expect there to be information about their alerts on My VA, in addition to a separate alerts page.** Many participants were excited to see My VA, and mentioned that it would make tracking benefits easier. All users understood the difference between My VA and the Alerts page. 

> "Alerts are important to be on this page, it's important to keep in mind as you go through all the different pages."

> "It's good to see this here, it's like a one-stop shop."

**2. Users were very confused about *why* specific alerts were shown on My VA.** Most users thought that the alerts shown on My VA were there because they were more important than the other alerts on the alerts page. Users thought that the VA had specifically chosen those to elevate. Only 1 user recognized that they were the most recent alerts.

> "I'm confused why it's only showing me 3 on My VA.... I guess it's just a matter of understanding how they did this... "

> "Why would it only show me 3?? I can't understand this."

**3. 7 out of 8 users missed the 'View all alerts' link completely. Many users mentioned wanting it to be further up on the page and called out.** Almost all users scrolled right past this link, and if asked to go back to the alerts page they would use the link in the navigation.

> "If this information is already listed in alerts - I don't think this is extremely helpful. Especially knowing I have to scroll all the way down to see the rest of my alerts. I'd prefer to just see 'View all alerts' at the top, with some kind of reminder to say I have new things to look at. OR if it's a message, maybe that could also be a hyperlink as well, maybe under 'Go to your profile'."

> "You know where it says 'view all alerts'... I want it to stand out more- it shouldn't just be part of the page like everything else."

### Prioritization

**1. Though users expect to see personalized alerts - they don't expect prioritization to be automatically specific to them.** Many users gave the sentiment that it depends on what is happening in a Veterans life, so a certain alert could be much more important at a certain time. Many participants gave the example of if they had a major health problem, then their appointment or messages alerts would be the most important. However, if they had been waiting for their appeal hearing then that would become the most important. Users mentioned that having the ability to sort or customize their page would help them set prioritization on their own page.

> "Your individual concerns - if you have a major health problem. That would be more important than any forms or an appeal. Or for some people the appeal would be the most important."

> "What's important totally depends on what's happening in a Veterans life."

**2. Users made a clear distinction between an 'action item' (something that the Veteran needs to DO) and a 'notification' (something that the Veteran should know).** They wanted to be able to quickly see what needs to be done, act on it and get off the site. There was a shared sentiment that the other 'notifications' were important, but much less than something that requires action from them.

> "Reminder is a soft notice, vs a hard notice. Like the appointment vs the application"

> "It's more important for me to see the alerts than notifications. I have a lot going on - so I don't have time to like read through all of this. Or energy. I would want to know if there was a problem with my medication. If it was going to be late, I would want to know that."

> "Some of these are more-so notifications and reminders, I think action items should be separate and called out. Like this form, this should be a separate sub task under alerts listed as action items. Maybe with another red dot - I have action items to complete. More so than just a generic notification." 

**3. All users mentioned time-sensitivity and unexpected problems as something to be prioritized.** Users mentioned that if something is going to expire, or if something is time-sensitive they would want that to be called out in some way that they can't miss. They also mentioned wanting to know if there was a problem, like if a claim was missing paperwork or an appointment got cancelled - that should be called out.

> "If something has a short shelf life, make it noticeable. Make it stand out, like BAM."

> "Nothing is important until it becomes a problem."

## Things Veterans mentioned they'd want to see as an alert

- Annual amount of disability compensation
- Appointments
- Benefits that Veterans are entitled to
- Claims and appeals information
- Covid-19 updates
- Debt payments
- Education payments
- Home loan information (lenders, local APRs, loan status)
- Messages
- Physician referral approvals
- Prescriptions
- Timeline on appeals
- Updates from the VA
- Veteran organizations available to join


## Additional findings

- Users expected the messaging link to take them directly to the specific message that the alert is about, not the messaging page on MHV.
- Users wanted to see a subject line in the messages alert to give them more context, so they can determine if they want to click into it.
- Users mentioned the following features as missing on My VA:
  - Preferred facility/hospital
  - Primary care physician
  - Primary care location 
- Users pointed out the icon in the form alert as something that would make them think it was important.

## Recommendations

### Alerts

1. Pick a title. I recommend naming this feature either 'Notifications' or 'Alerts'. We need to align with the similarly titled 'Notification Preferences' feature, as that will be built and launched first.
2. Add design considerations for each alert section to help with scannability (e.g. health care, claims, covid)
3. Discuss an appropriate timeline for alerts
4. Deprioritize representing read vs unread alerts for MVP
5. Deprioritize including the ability to sort alerts by section, date or time-sensitivity for MVP

### My VA

1. Revisit how we represent alerts on My VA
2. Make the link 'View all alerts' easier to find
3. Continue pursuing a more personalized homepage on VA.gov 

### Prioritization

1. Explore ways to differentiate between things that need action vs things that do not need action within our technological constraints
2. Launch prioritized alerts with an educated guess based on the criteria that users mentioned (time-sensitive and/or an unexpected problem)
3. Learn more about prioritization! I recommend doing a card sort to make sure weâ€™re on the right track as well as setting up parameters in Google Analytics after we launch


## Next Steps

New epic for this phase of work: [#30611](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30611)

### 1. Scope MVP
GH Issue: [#30608](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30608)

   - [ ] Create project outline 
   - [ ] Clearly define the goals of this project and MVP
   - [ ] Clearly define the scope of MVP
   - [ ] Work with team to figure out what should or should not (or can and cannot) be included in MVP

### 2. Figure out what alerts should be included based on other initiatives (and how to include them) - _this should be done as part of (and at the same time as) scoping the MVP_
GH Issues: 
- Design/PM: [#30612](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30612)
- FE/BE: [#30613](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30613)

   - [ ] This provides a platform for other teams to interface with - we want to connect! We need to figure out how.
      - [ ] Talk to Bev Nelson and Maria 
   - [ ] Connect with other teams to discuss current work and see how that fits into alerts (GI Bill & Health care apartment)
   - [ ] Outline each initiative and determine technological constraints

### 3. Understand each alert in MVP
GH Issue: [#30610](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30610)

   - [ ] Work with VAnotify and VetText to understand how the current APIs work, how to connect to them and/or if we need to build something new
   - [ ] Work with VAnotify and VetText to understand content of each alert
   - [ ] Outline actionability of each alert - if not, put actionable alerts on My VA

### 4. Figure out how to incorporate an alerts link into the IA/header (work with Ryan Thurlwell)
Gh Issue: [#30615](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30615)
   - [ ] Explore ways to show an Alerts link in the navigation
   - [ ] Work with the appropriate parties to get it implemented


### 5. Implement section design considerations
GH Issue: [#30607](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30607)
   - [ ] Implement designs to differentiate between sections of alerts (e.g. health care vs. covid reminder)
       - [ ] Outline what each section is and what it includes

### 6. Restructure the Alerts section on My VA
GH Issue: [#30636](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30636)
   - [ ] Restructure the alerts section to better reflect what already exists in My VA by only elevating â€˜action itemâ€™ alerts and prioritizing the link to â€˜View allâ€™

### 7. Prioritization 
GH Issue TK -- _Should the first two items here be part of the tasks needed to define MVP and outline alert items for MVP (issues 30608, 30612, 30613)? Should the third item be part of "Test" (item 10) below?_

   - [ ] Determine what MVP alerts qualify as an 'action item' vs a 'notification' 
   - [ ] Differentiate action items and notifications
   - [ ] Post-launch run a card sort to determine which alerts qualify as time sensitive or an unexpected problem (product direction vs product performance)

### 8. Meet with the mobile team to discuss a title
GH Issue: [#30637](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30637)
   - [ ] AJ will set up a meeting

### 9. Start the collab cycle
   - [ ] Once we've made the changes outlined above, then we should start a formal collaboration cycle

### 10. Test
   - [ ] Run a usability study to understand if the updates improve confusion on My VA and if we need to make additional changes

### 11. Deprioritize

#### Deprioritize read vs unread alerts for MVP 
   - [ ] Table this for now. In the future we can revisit it once we get the MVP up and running.

#### Deprioritize adding in the ability to sort for MVP
   - [ ] Table this for now. In the future we can revisit it once we get the MVP up and running.
