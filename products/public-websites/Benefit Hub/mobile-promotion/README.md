# Initiative Brief Template
#### Overview

Currently there is limited marketing of the VA.gov mobile app from within the benefit hubs. Using patterns created by Apple and others e.g. [Smart App Banners](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/promoting_apps_with_smart_app_banners) we can increase the adoption and overall use of the VA.gov mobile app by placing the banners on the appropriate tool landing pages that map to features/functions available in the mobile app.

## Outcome Summary
Increase the download/use/adoption of the VA.gov mobile app.

**Related/Associated product(s)**
- [Benefit hub product](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites/Benefit%20Hub)
- [ VA.gov Mobile app](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app) 

## Problem
* How might we use the VA.gov website to encourage use of native mobile apps as it aligns with specific features on VA.gov.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Using the mobile app allows Veterans to access self-service tools more readily

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Frustration because the app 


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Increased adoption of the Mobile App (ongoing use)

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
> ðŸ’¡ *VA.gov products measure success against Ease of use, Service Completion, Trust/Satisfaction, Health.*<sup>1</sup>\
> ðŸ’¡ *Identify balancing metrics to ensure you're not bringing about undesired outcomes.*

| Product KPI | Baseline | Target | Link to data source (e.g. GA, Domo) | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Downloads of VA.gov Mobile App (aggregate) | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Downloads of VA.gov Mobile App via SmartApp banner | N/A | ----- | ----- | ----- |

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
- Mobile app does not have 100% parity with VA.gov website and that's OK. This UX feature will only appear on tool landing pages that have parity.
- Cannibalizing mobile web traffic to mobile app use is a good thing.
- Only targeting Apple users is sufficient for proof-of-concept and learnings are transferrable to Android device user behavior.
- We can use the out-of-the-box design behavior from Apple for POC and there will not be accessibility problems.

### What're you building

MVP will be to:
* Use Apple's Smart App Banners only, because this is COTS OOB behavior requiring no design and leveraging existing user-expected patterns.
* Create a means by which we specify the specific URLs app promotion happens
* Place the Smart banner on the following pages mapped to the following functions. (Note, we cannot deep-link into the App at this time)
