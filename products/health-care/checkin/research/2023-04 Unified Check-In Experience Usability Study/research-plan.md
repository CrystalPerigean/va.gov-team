# Patient Check In (PCI) Research Plan for Unified Check-In Generative Research Usability Study  

Last modified: April 20, 2023

## Background 

The Patient Check In (PCI) product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The Modernized Check-In Experience Team created the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to “check in” through VA.gov. I.e., letting clinic staff know that the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Check-in enables Veterans with appointments to: 

- Review and confirm their information prior to an appointment, also known as pre-check-in, which includes: 

     - Confirming their appointment
     - Reviewing their contact information 
     - Reviewing their emergency contact information
     - Reviewing their next of kin information 

- Utilize their smartphone to check-in on the day of their appointment

### Creating a Unified Check-In Experience 

The Modernized Check-In Experience Team has received feedback from Veterans and staff that PCI is too complicated. Specifically, the feedback includes: 

- Veterans and staff don’t understand the difference between pre-check-in and check-in. 
- Many Veterans use the pre-check-in link that was texted to them to initiate check-in on the day of their appointment, which does not actually allow them to check in. 
- Some Veterans skip checking in altogether when they arrive at the clinic because they think they’re checked in as a result of completing the pre-check-in process, which in fact does not initiate or complete the online check in process.

To mitigate these concerns, the Modernized Check-In Experience Team has decided to do some generative research around merging our two applications into one (i.e., a unified check-in experience) to remove the confusion between pre-check-in and check-in.

In this scenario, when Veterans access the new PCI web app, an appointment card component will be used to highlight the upcoming appointment that requires immediate attention. For example, the appointment needs to be confirmed or checked into.

In addition, we will start showing Veterans all of their upcoming appointments as a solution for making their health appointment information more accessible, creating better consistency among other apps and web experiences across VA that provide health appointment information and enabling them to complete other related actions during a single interaction. 

### OCTO Objectives 

This research plan supports the following OCTO objectives:

## Research Goals 

The purpose of this research is to **get feedback from Veterans on the new unified PCI experience idea** and, specifically, about ease of use and how well it meets expectations.

### Research Questions

#### Primary Questions 

1. Do Veterans find it confusing that confirming an appointment is a two step process?  
1. How easy or difficult is it to understand that you still need to complete the online check in process even if you’ve confirmed the appointment a few days prior?  
1. How easy or difficult is it to check in to an appointment? 
1. Do Veterans think the check in confirmation page provides enough information about the status of their check in and what to do next?
1. How easy or difficult is it to understand if other upcoming appointments require attention? For example, another appointment needs to be confirmed or checked into. 
1. How easy or difficult is it to understand the difference between confirming an appointment and checking in to an appointment?
1. Do Veterans find it useful or not to view the rest of their upcoming appointments when confirming or checking into one of their appointments? 
1. Would Veterans find it helpful to receive a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments with instructions on how to check in on their smartphone? 

#### Secondary Questions 

9. How easy or difficult is it to find where to confirm an appointment or check in to an appointment from the appointment details page? 
10. Do Veterans expect to see which of their appointments have already been confirmed? If so, on the appointment list page or detail page?  

### Hypothesis 

#### Primary Questions 

1. Do Veterans find it confusing that confirming an appointment is a two step process?  
     - LIKELY FALSE: Most Veterans will find the two step process easy to understand. 
2. How easy or difficult is it to understand that you still need to complete the online check in process even if you’ve confirmed the appointment a few days prior? 
     - MAYBE TRUE: Some Veterans will understand that confirming an appointment does not replace checking in to an appointment and they will recommend making that distinction more clear at the completion of confirming an appointment. 
3. How easy or difficult is it to check in to an appointment? 
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: Veterans will think the process for checking in to an appointment is easy. 
4. Do Veterans think the check in confirmation page provides enough information about the status of their check in and what to do next?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: Veterans will think the information on the confirmation page when checking in to an appointment is well organized and prioritized. 
5. How easy or difficult is it to understand if other upcoming appointments require attention? For example, another appointment needs to be confirmed or checked into. 
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans will find it easy to understand that other upcoming appointments require attention, but might recommend highlighting those tasks even more in the appointment list to draw their attention. 
6. How easy or difficult is it to understand the difference between confirming an appointment and checking in to an appointment?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans will understand the difference between confirming an appointment and checking in to an appointment. 
7. Do Veterans find it useful or not to view the rest of their upcoming appointments when confirming or checking into one of their appointments? 
     - LIKELY TRUE: Veterans will like seeing all of their upcoming appointments in one place, even if it’s within the context of needing to confirm their appointment or check in to an appointment. 
8. Would Veterans find it helpful to receive a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments with instructions on how to check in on their smartphone?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: Veterans will prefer receiving a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments compared to scanning a poster at the clinics.  

#### Secondary Questions 

9. How easy or difficult is it to find where to confirm an appointment or check in to an appointment from the appointment details page? 
     - LIKELY TRUE: Veterans will find it easy to locate where to start the process of confirming an appointment or checking in to an appointment from the appointment details page, but might recommend adding some separation between the appointment information and the action link to make it more noticeable. 
10. Do Veterans expect to see which of their appointments have already been confirmed? If so, on the appointment list page or detail page? 
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans will expect to see which of their upcoming appointments have already been confirmed, especially if they just completed that process for one of their appointments.   

## Methodology 

This research will be conducted as a remote moderated user research study that utilizes an accessible prototype built for mobile devices. Participants will be asked to complete specific tasks for usability testing and asked follow-up questions to gain understanding of expectations and satisfaction.
