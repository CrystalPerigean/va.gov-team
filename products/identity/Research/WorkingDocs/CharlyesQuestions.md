## Generic Questions
### Communication Options
* How do Vets learn about VA.gov?  
* Relationship with DSLogon and messaging to users?
* Relationship with MHV and messaging to users?

### Other websites
* Which sites inform Vets about the various CSPs? How can we work together to encourage leveraging Login.gov? 
	* Finding #1 LGA Discovery research: “Setting up a new credential is frustrating for Veterans if it’s made to seem like a choice or the need is unclear.”
	* E.g. AccessVA, various VA services?
* What messaging is in place to encourage new users to create Login.gov credentials vs others?
* Value of AccessVA as a "window" - when users access MHV/other VA websites, what tasks are they wanting to accomplish?  Why would they go to one website versus another?

## Potential Research Questions
* As part of the discovery, one of the confirmed hypotheses was that there should not be a disruption in a Vet’s ability to access services, when offboarding from one login method e.g. DSLogon or MHV, what are the deltas between what vets can access on VA.gov?
* Finding #6 from LGA Discovery research: “Veterans will choose whichever login credential is familiar, or, seems more direct to complete a task.” What influences/determines how a Vet perceives what is the most “direct” route to take to accomplish a task? Is there an opportunity to educate/re-educate and/or simplify the pathways to accomplish said task?  If VA.gov is the simplest way, how might we encourage Vets to leverage this as a direct path?  Does this contradict the value of AccessVA?  Is that something we even need to be concerned about?
Potentially the “apartment” epic but on the generative aspect
* What is the “value” proposition of Login.gov over other CSPs?  How can we clearly communicate that to Vets when they have so many options?
	* E.g. Id.me gives vets kickbacks when they go shopping
