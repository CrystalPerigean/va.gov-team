# IA Review and Recommendations

**Team:** Health Care Products/VAOS

**Product/Featue:** VA Online Scheduling

**Background/Context:** Redesign of existing tool for online scheduling of VA appointments.  Some appointments can be scheduled online and some clinics only allow you to "request" an appointment.  Access/ability to schedule/request varies by clinic. 

**Review Date:** 11/7/2019

### IA and URL 

**Structure:**   
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation*

- New tool will live as a child to the existing static page


**URLs:**
*Final URLs to be used*

Unauthenticated Static Page
- Existing static page will be used as entry point to new tool, no IA or URL changes will be made to the page at this time
- URL: No change (https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/)
- Breadcrumb: No change (Home > Health care > Schedule and view appointments)

Tool:   
- initial URL: https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/appointments/
- Subsequent pages will add on to the above URL using short and simple labels, i.e. www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/appointments/introduction/

Added 2/28/2020 (@mnorthuis)
- Breadcrumb: Home > Health care > Schedule and view appointments > Your appointments
  - The last component of the breadcrumb should be similar to the H1 of the page, work with your writer to finalize

### Navigation/Entry Points

**Primary**
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation*

- No changes to entry points are needed.  The existing static page content will be updated to direct users to the new tool. 

**Crosslinking**
*Recommendations for potential cross-linking opportunities.  This can be reviewed and modified/added to by the working team.*

- No additional crosslinking recommendations at this time. 

<hr>

### Redirects/Canonical 
*Identify if any redirect or canonical tags are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

- None at this time.

### Additional Notes/Recommendations

- Work with content/writing team to determine how to best represent "schedule" versus "request" functionality - need to determine whether these labels have an impact on user expectations.

- If the team chooses to change the static page URL (i.e. change "schedule" to "request"), a redirect will need to be implemented from old to new URL
