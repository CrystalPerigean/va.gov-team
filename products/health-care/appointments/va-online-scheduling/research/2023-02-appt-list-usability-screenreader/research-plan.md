Research plan for VAOS appointments list screenreader usability test
=============

Background
----------

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

The VA Online Scheduling team has worked to evaluate the usability of the existing appointment list. A redesign of the appointment list was created based on the [feedback](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/2022-appts-list-usability/research-findings.md) during Veteran research sessions. The usability of the redesign was then tested with Veterans and the findings were incorporated in updated designs. The VA Online scheduling team now seeks feedback from Veterans using screenreaders to validate the changes made to the appointment list for low and non-sighted Veterans. 

Also see [Product's initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/appointment-list/product-outline-appointment-list-2022.md).

### OCTO Objectives

<!-- Check the OCTO objectives, are there any specifically about access? Or that a screenreader usability study would address? -->

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase ðŸ“ˆ

-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an appointments list that meets Veteran expectations and needs.

Decrease ðŸ“‰

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

-   MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

-   MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
-   MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

-   Maintaining my emotional health
-   Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring

-   MTM: Taking care of my health
-   MTM: Managing my declining health

Research goals
--------------

The goal of this research is to improve navigation for Veterans using screenreaders.

### Outcome

We will use the findings to:

-   Provide an appointment list that is easy for screenreader users to navigate.

### Hypotheses

When Veterans use a screenreader on the appointment list:

-   They will be able to easily navigate their appointments.
-   They will be able to find the information they need to attend/join their appointments.

### Research Questions

**Evaluate screenreader usability and value of the appointment list redesign.**

- How do Veterans typically manage their appointments?
- Does the information for each appointment make sense?
- Can Veterans differentiate between appointments?
- Can Veterans navigate to Past appointments?
- Can Veterans navigate to Pending appointments?
- What would Veterans' next steps be?

Method
------

With screenreader participants only, we will run a moderated usability test of the appointment list. 

### Location

Remote, over Zoom.
