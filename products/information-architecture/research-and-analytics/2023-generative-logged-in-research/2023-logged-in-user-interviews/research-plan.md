# Research plan for logged-in IA and navigation, Account Experience, March 2023

## Background
While we’ve observed some high-level problems people have navigating VA.gov’s logged-in experience (eg. people are reliant on homepage and My VA links), we’ve never conducted research that is solely dedicated to this topic. To remedy this, we’re conducting a variety of research activities, including user interviews, to help us clarify exactly what problems exist with the logged-in navigation, where we are not meeting users’ expectations, and what we might do to improve the overall experience. 

[Research brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/2023-logged-in-user-interviews/README.md)

### OCTO Objectives 
**This research will directly support all of the OCTO north stars:**
 1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
 2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
 3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

**As well as the following 2023 objectives:**
1. Enhance veterans’ personalized online experience
2. Refresh the VA.gov homepage and information architecture
3. Integrate the health portal features into VA.gov
4. Improve the veteran login experience

### Veteran Journey
The research covers a broad spectrum of VA services, and applies at any stage from Starting Up through Aging.

## Research Goals	
Our goal with this research is to identify problems and expectations with navigating the logged-in experience on VA.gov.

### Outcome
The insights we learn from people during these interviews will guide meaningful improvements to the logged-in IA and navigation in the coming year.

### Research questions

#### Navigation and wayfinding
* How do people navigate to tasks they came to VA.gov to complete? 
	* How do they navigate to those tasks without relying on homepage/My VA links?
* How do people navigate to personalized information?
- What do people do when they:
	- have trouble with the website
	- feel information is inaccurate
	- need help with something
	- can’t find what they need
	- have questions in general
* How can we make the site easier to navigate for logged-in users?

#### Logged-in mental model and expectations
* What are people’s expectations of the website experience after they’ve logged in?
* How do people differentiate “logged in / authenticated” parts of the website, and “unauthenticated” parts of the website? 
* Does the current experience cause confusion?
* How do navigation needs and expectations differ between user types?

### Hypothesis
- People will struggle finding what they’re looking for if they can’t use the homepage or My VA.
- People will give up or call VA if they can’t find what they need on the VA.gov.
- People’s expectations of a logged-in VA.gov experience will not be much different than the current experience.
- Navigation needs and expectations will be similar across user types.

## Methodology	
This will be a moderated wayfinding study conducted remotely over Zoom.

1. We’d like you to review parts of the VA website that require you to log in to an identity-verified account.  **Do you have an identify-verified account on VA.gov?** 

You can check on this by logging into VA.gov. If you see a prompt to verify your identity once you log in, your identity is **not** yet verified.

Response options: yes or no
(Answering yes would qualify the participant.)

2. Please provide the email address you use to log in with your VA.gov identity-verified account. We’ll use this to give you access to the version of the website we’d like to get your feedback on.

Response: text box

3. Do you find it difficult to remember or learn new things, focus on a task, or make decisions?

**Note:** We ask this question because we want to make sure that our tools work for people who live with challenges like these.

Response options: yes or no

(Proceed to question 4a if yes)

4a.  We want to make sure our website works for people with various levels of experience with screen readers. Please rate your experience level using a screen reader:

Response options: yes or no
	
4c. Please list the name of the screen reader technology you will use during the session.
